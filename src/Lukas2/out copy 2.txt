Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.\n Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight with the elbows pointed out. Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight. At the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.3. As full extension is achieved, transition into the receiving position by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. Aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.\n Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position. Return the weight to the boxes for the next rep.\n

Barbell Full Squat                                    | Compound  | Quadriceps  | Barbell       | Strength              | Intermediate | 9.4 | Barbell front squat                           | Leg Press                                             | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack just above shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.\n Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting back with your hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your hamstrings are on your calves. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\n Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel or middle of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nThis type of squat allows a greater range of motion, and allows the trunk to maintain a more vertical position than other types of squats, due to foot position and the higher bar position.

Ensure that your back is straight and stays that way for the duration of the exercise. Allow your arms to hang perpendicular to the floor, with the wrists pronated and the elbows pointed to your sides. This will be your starting position.\n Initiate the movement by flexing your hips, slowly pushing your butt as far back as you can. This should entail a horizontal movement of the hips, rather than a downward movement. The knees should only partially bend, and your weight should remain on your heels.\n Drive your butt back as far as you can, which should generate tension in your hamstrings as your hands approach knee level. Maintain an arch in your back throughout the exercise.\n When your hips cannot perform any further backward movement, pause, and then slowly return to the starting position by extending the hips.\n

Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired.\n Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.\n With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.\n Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe.\n

Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.\n Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\n Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\n As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.\n Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.\n The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.\n Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.\n At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be split, with one foot forward, and one foot back. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead. Return to a standing position.\n

Clean the kettlebell to your shoulder by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the kettlebell towards your shoulder. Rotate your wrist as you do so, so that the palm faces forward. This will be your starting position.\n Dip your body by bending the knees, keeping your torso upright.\n Immediately reverse direction, driving through the heels, in essence jumping to create momentum.

Bring the hips down and make sure that your body drops as if you were going to sit on a chair. This will be your starting position.\n Start pushing the floor as if it were a moving platform with your feet and simultaneously start lifting the barbell keeping it close to your legs.\n As the bar reaches the middle of your thighs, push the floor with your legs and lift your body to a complete extension in an explosive motion.\n Lift your shoulders back in a shrugging movement as you bring the bar up while lifting your elbows out to the side and keeping them above the bar for as long as possible.\n Now in a very quick but powerful motion, you have to get your body under the barbell when it has reached a high enough point where it can be controlled and drop while locking your arms and holding the barbell overhead as you assume a squat position.\n Finalize the movement by rising up out of the squat position to finish the lift. At the end of the lift both feet should be on line and the arms fully extended holding the barbell overhead.\n\nCaution: This is a very advanced exercise so be extremely careful with the weight used. Bad form on this exercise can lead to serious injury.

Approach the bar so that the bar intersects the middle of the feet. The feet should be set very wide, near the collars. Bend at the hips to grip the bar. The arms should be directly below the shoulders, inside the legs, and you can use a pronated grip, a mixed grip, or hook grip. Relax the shoulders, which in effect lengthens your arms.\n Take a breath, and then lower your hips, looking forward with your head with your chest up. Drive through the floor, spreading your feet apart, with your weight on the back half of your feet. Extend through the hips and knees.\n As the bar passes through the knees, lean back and drive the hips into the bar, pulling your shoulder blades together.\n Return the weight to the ground by bending at the hips and controlling the weight on the way down.\n

Your back should be straight and inclined slightly forward.\n Begin by aggressively extending through the hips, knees and ankles, driving the weight upward. As you do so, shrug your shoulders towards your ears. As full extension is achieved, transition into the final pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.3. Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.\n

Lean your upper body back to form a 45-degree angle with the floor. Bring your feet off the ground so that your body resembles a "V" shape.\n Grasp a dumbbell in each hand and hold tight to your chest with palms facing each other. This will be your starting position.\n While keeping your core tight and maintaining your body's "V" position, quickly extend your left arm straight out (similar to a jab) and then bring it back to the starting position while simultaneously punching out with the right arm.\n Your torso and legs may slightly rotate side to side opposite of your hands throughout the movement—this is okay.\n A punch with each hand counts as one total repetition. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.\n

Set up the bands either on band pegs or attached to the top of the rack, ensuring they will be directly above the bar during the squat. Attach the other end to the bar.\n Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.\n With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.\n Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe. Use care to return the barbell to the rack.\n

Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\n As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.\n Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\n After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.\n Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n

Don't let your body slip down from this position.\n Hold your legs parallel to the floor using your abs to hold them there while keeping your knees and feet together. Tip: Your legs should be fully extended with a slight bend on the knee. This will be your starting position.\n While exhaling, move your legs towards the torso as you roll your pelvis backwards and you raise your hips off the bench. At the end of this movement your knees will be touching your chest.\n Hold the contraction for a second and move your legs back to the starting position while inhaling.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n
Dumbbell Bench Press                                  | Compound  | Chest       | Dumbbell      | Strength              | Intermediate | 9.2 | Barbell Bench Press - Medium Grip             | Incline dumbbell bench press                          | Kettlebell alternating floor press                  | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.\n Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.\n Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position.\n Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.\n\nCaution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.\n\nJust lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor.\n

Position the rope behind you on the ground. Raise your arms up and turn the rope over your head bringing it down in front of you. When it reaches the ground, jump over it. Find a good turning pace that can be maintained. Different speeds and techniques can be used to introduce variation.\n Rope jumping is exciting, challenges your coordination, and requires a lot of energy. A 150 lb person will burn about 350 calories jumping rope for 30 minutes, compared to over 450 calories running.\n

Tip: Your grip should be wider than shoulder width and it should create a 90-degree angle between the forearm and the upper arm as the barbell goes down.\n Once you pick up the barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. This is your starting position.\n Lower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale.\n Lift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

Power Clean from Blocks                               | Compound  | Hamstrings  | Barbell       | Olympic Weightlifting | Beginner     | 9.2 | Power clean                                   | Hang Clean                                            | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | With a barbell on boxes of the desired height, take a grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.\n Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips.\n In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight. At the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\n As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, pull yourself under the bar far enough that it can be racked onto the shoulders, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed.\n Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position, and complete the repetition by returning the weight to the boxes.\n

Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.\n While keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.\n Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution:\n\n This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.\n Also, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.\n Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\n

This will be your starting position.\n Lower the bar as far as possible, while inhaling and keeping a tight grip.\n Now curl the bar up as high as possible while contracting the forearms. Tip: Only the wrist should move; not the forearms.\n After a second contraction at the top go back to the starting position as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms.\n Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back.\n Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

Using a close grip (around shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.\n As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that - as opposed to a regular bench press - you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement.\n After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else.\n

Your legs should be straight and your arms extended behind your head. This will be your starting position.\n To perform the movement, tuck the knees toward your chest, rotating your pelvis to lift your glutes from the floor. As you do so, flex the spine, bringing your arms back over your head to perform a simultaneous crunch motion.\n After a brief pause, return to the starting position.\n

This will be your starting position.\n Now curl up and bring your right elbow and shoulder across your body while bring your left knee in toward your left shoulder at the same time. Reach with your elbow and try to touch your knee. Exhale as you perform this movement. Tip: Try to bring your shoulder up towards your knee rather than just your elbow and remember that the key is to contract the abs as you perform the movement; not just to move the elbow.\n Now go back down to the starting position as you inhale and repeat with the left elbow and the right knee.\n Continue alternating in this manner until all prescribed repetitions are done.\n\nVariation: You can also do all of your repetitions for one side and then switch to the other side.

The palms of your hand will be facing each other.\n Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position.\n With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.\n Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.\n Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n

The palms of your hands will be facing each other.\n Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width.\n Once you have the dumbbells raised to shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position.\n Be sure to keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. Then breathe out and push the dumbbells up with your chest.\n Lock your arms at the top, hold for a second, and then start slowly lowering the weight. Tip Ideally, lowering the weights should take about twice as long as raising them.\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n When you are done, place the dumbbells back on your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to release the dumbbells.\n

Move cable to highest pulley position.\n Stand with side to cable. With one hand, reach up and grab handle with underhand grip.\n Pull down cable until elbow touches your side and the handle is by your shoulder.\n Position feet hip-width apart. Place free hand on hip to help gauge pivot point.\n Keep arm in static position. Contract oblique to bring the weight down in a side crunch.\n Once you reach maximum contraction, slowly release the weight to the starting position. The weight stack should never be unloaded in a resting position. The aim is constant tension during the set.\n Repeat to failure.\n Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.\n\nTip: Keep your arm tucked in tight to your side; don’t move it. This technique will ensure the weight is isolated directly to the obliques and not your biceps or shoulder.

You can choose a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Use caution so that you don’t trip as you climb the stairs. It is recommended that you maintain your grip on the handles so that you don’t fall.\n Stepmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside while offering a similar rate of calories burned. They are typically much harder than other cardio equipment. A 150 lb person will typically burn over 300 calories in 30 minutes, compared to about 175 calories walking.\n

Weighted bench dip                                    | Compound  | Triceps     | Body Only     | Strength              | Intermediate | 9.1 | Triceps dip                                   | Dip Machine                                           | Feet-elevated bench dip                             | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back and another one in front of you. With the benches perpendicular to your body, hold on to one bench on its edge with the hands close to your body, separated at shoulder width. Your arms should be fully extended.\n The legs will be extended forward on top of the other bench. Your legs should be parallel to the floor while your torso is to be perpendicular to the floor. Have your partner place the dumbbell on your lap. Note: This exercise is best performed with a partner as placing the weight on your lap can be challenging and cause injury without assistance. This will be your starting position.\n Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down.\n Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position while exhaling.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: By placing your legs on top of another flat bench in front of you, the exercise becomes more challenging. It is best to attempt this exercise without any weights at first in order to get used to the movements required for good form. If that variation also becomes easy, then you can have a partner place plates on top of your lap. Make sure that in this case the partner ensures that the weights stay there throughout the movement.

Have a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused by this exercise.\n Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lean back against the bench so that your shoulder blades are near the top of it.\n Begin the movement by driving through your feet, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your shoulder blades and your feet. Extend as far as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position.\n

Your knees should be unlocked and your hand on your hips. This is your starting position.\n Take a moderate-length step forward with one foot, descending to a point in which your rear knee approaches the floor without touching, maintaining your body's upright posture. Your front knee should bend about 90 degrees, but for knee health it should not be forward of the vertical plane that extends straight up from your toes. If so, take a slightly longer step.\n From the bottom position, push back up from your forward foot, bringing it back beside the other.\n Repeat on the opposite side for the required number of repetitions.\n
Barbell Bench Press - Medium Grip                     | Compound  | Chest       | Barbell       | Strength              | Intermediate | 9   | Dumbbell Bench Press                          | Smith machine bench press                             | Machine chest press                                 | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.\n From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.\n After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution:\n\nIf you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\n\nAlso, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to touch your middle chest and nowhere else.\n\nDon't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.

Concentration curl                                    | Isolation | Biceps      | Dumbbell      | Strength              | Intermediate | 9   | Cable rope preacher hammer curl               | High Cable Curls                                      | n/a                                                 | Not Yet Rated                           | Palms-out incline biceps curl | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Sit down on a flat bench with one dumbbell in front of you between your legs. Your legs should be spread with your knees bent and feet on the floor.\n Use your right arm to pick the dumbbell up. Place the back of your right upper arm on the top of your inner right thigh. Rotate the palm of your hand until it is facing forward away from your thigh. Tip: Your arm should be extended and the dumbbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position.\n While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Tip: At the top of the movement make sure that the little finger of your arm is higher than your thumb. This guarantees a good contraction. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.\n Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in. Caution: Avoid swinging motions at any time.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Then repeat the movement with the left arm.\n
Decline Crunch                                        | Isolation | Abdominals  | Body Only     | Strength              | Intermediate | 9   | Reverse crunch                                | Ab Crunch Machine                                     | Seated leg tuck                                     | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down.\n Now place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Don't lock your fingers behind your head.\n While pushing the small of your back down in the bench to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off it.\n Continue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the bench only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the bench. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using momentum.\n After the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

The palms of your hand will be facing each other.\n Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width. The palms of the hands should be facing each other and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor and fully extended. This will be your starting position.\n With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.\n Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.\n Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nVariation: You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation.

Tip: You may use wrist wraps in order to facilitate holding on to the bar.\n Now bend your knees at a 90 degree angle and bring the upper legs forward so that the calves are perpendicular to the floor while the thighs remain parallel to it. This will be your starting position.\n Pull your legs up as you exhale until you almost touch your shins with the bar above you. Tip: Try to straighten your legs as much as possible while at the top.\n Lower your legs as slowly as possible until you reach the starting position. Tip: Avoid swinging and using momentum at all times.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n
Narrow-stance squat                                   | Compound  | Quadriceps  | Barbell       | Strength              | Expert       | 9   | Dumbbell squat                                | Narrow Stance Hack Squats                             | Narrow-stance leg press                             | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart. Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\n
Kneeling cable oblique crunch                         | Isolation | Abdominals  | Cable         | Strength              | Intermediate | 9   | Feet-elevated oblique crunch                  | Kneeling Cable Crunch With Alternating Oblique Twists | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Connect a rope attachment to a high pulley cable and position the mat on the floor in front of you.\n Take the rope with both hands and kneel approximately 1-2 feet from the column. Position the rope behind your head; your hands being next to your ears. This will be your starting position.\n Keeping your hands in place, pull the rope downward in a crunching motion. As you flex the spine, twist to bring your elbow to the opposite knee.\n Pause briefly at the bottom of the motion, and then return to the starting position.\n
Reverse Grip Triceps Pushdown                         | Isolation | Triceps     | Cable         | Strength              | Intermediate | 9   | Single-arm cable triceps extension            | One Arm Supinated Dumbbell Triceps Extension          | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Start by setting a bar attachment (straight or e-z) on a high pulley machine.\n Facing the bar attachment, grab it with the palms facing up (supinated grip) at shoulder width. Lower the bar by using your lats until your arms are fully extended by your sides. Tip: Elbows should be in by your sides and your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position.\n Slowly elevate the bar attachment up as you inhale so it is aligned with your chest. Only the forearms should move and the elbows/upper arms should be stationary by your side at all times.\n Then begin to lower the cable bar back down to the original staring position while exhaling and contracting the triceps hard.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariation: This exercise can also be performed with a single handle using one arm at a time. This will allow you to better isolate the triceps. With this version you can self spot yourself by placing your hand over your forearm and applying some pressure to help you perform more reps than before.

Bend down so that your hands are on the ground. Your back should be flat and knees bent. This is your starting position.\n Begin by driving with legs, alternating left and right. Use your hands to maintain balance and to help pull. Try to keep your back flat as you move over a given distance.\n

This is your starting position.\n Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\n After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.\n Now repeat the same movements as described above except this time your torso will remain straight as you go up and the bar will touch the back of the neck instead of the upper chest. Tip: Use the head to lean forward slightly as it will help you properly execute this portion of the exercise.\n Once you have lowered yourself back down to the starting position, repeat the exercise for the prescribed amount of repetitions in your program.\n\nCaution: The behind the neck variation can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck so this exercise is not recommended for people with shoulder problems.\n

Keep your head facing forward throughout. Lift the bar off your traps; this will be your starting position.\n Keeping your elbows under the bar, press the bar overhead to full arm extension and lower under control without overextending your shoulders and leaning your head forward just a bit. Repeat for reps.\n
Box Squat with Bands                                  | Compound  | Quadriceps  | Barbell       | Powerlifting          | Beginner     | 9   | Barbell back squat to box                     | Box Squat with Chains                                 | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Set up the bands on the sleeves, secured to either band pegs, the rack, or dumbbells so that there is appropriate tension. If dumbbells are used, secure them so that they don't move. Also, ensure that the dumbbells you are using are heavy enough for the bands that you are using. Additional plates can be used to hold the dumbbells down. If more tension is needed, you can either widen the base on the floor or choke the bands. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired.\n Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.\n With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.\n Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe. Use care to return the barbell to the rack.\n
Flexor Incline Dumbbell Curls                         | Isolation | Biceps      | Dumbbell      | Strength              | Beginner     | 9   | Alternating incline dumbbell biceps curl      | Palms-out incline biceps curl                         | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Hold the dumbbell towards the side farther from you so that you have more weight on the side closest to you. (This can be done for a good effect on all bicep dumbbell exercises). Now do a normal incline dumbbell curl, but keep your wrists as far back as possible so as to neutralize any stress that is placed on them.\n Sit on an incline bench that is angled at 45-degrees while holding a dumbbell on each hand.\n Let your arms hang down on your sides, with the elbows in, and turn the palms of your hands forward with the thumbs pointing away from the body. Tip: You will keep this hand position throughout the movement as there should not be any twisting of the hands as they come up. This will be your starting position.\n Curl up the two dumbbells at the same time until your biceps are fully contracted and exhale. Tip: Do not swing the arms or use momentum.

You could also use a weighted vest, sandbag, or other type of resistance for this exercise.\n The weight should be light enough that it doesn't slow you down significantly. Your feet should be just outside of shoulder width with your head and chest up. This will be your starting position.\n Using a countermovement, squat partially down and immediately reverse your direction to explode off of the ground, extending through your hips, knees, and ankles. Maintain good posture throughout the jump.\n As you return to the ground, absorb the impact through your legs.\n
Squat with Chains                                     | Compound  | Quadriceps  | Barbell       | Powerlifting          | Beginner     | 9   | Squat with Bands                              | Reverse Band Box Squat                                | Reverse Band Power Squat                            | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | To set up the chains, begin by looping the leader chain over the sleeves of the bar. The heavy chain should be attached using a snap hook. Adjust the length of the lead chain so that a few links are still on the floor at the top of the movement.\n Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wide for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings. Keep your head facing forward.\n With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips as much as possible. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Lower bar position necessitates a greater torso lean to keep the bar over the heels. Continue until you break parallel, which is defined as the crease of the hip being in line with the top of the knee.\n Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe, until you have returned to the starting position.\n

This will be your starting position.\n As you exhale, pull yourself up while crunching your knees up at the same time until your knees are at chest level. You will stop going up as soon as your nose is at the same level as the bar. Tip: When you get to this point you should also be finishing the crunch at the same time.\n Slowly start to inhale as you return to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

This will be your starting position.\n While keeping a slight arch on your back, lift your hips and roll the barbell towards your feet as you exhale. Tip: As you perform the movement, your glutes should be coming up, you should be keeping the abs tight and should maintain your back posture at all times. Also your arms should be staying perpendicular to the floor throughout the movement. If you don't, you will work out your shoulders and back more than the abs.\n After a second contraction at the top, start to roll the barbell back forward to the starting position slowly as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is a challenging exercise for people with healthy backs.\n\nVariation: This is an exercise that, just like the push-up, can also be done on the knees for less advanced athletes.

Tip: At this point your legs should be fully extended with the shins on top of the ball and the upper body should be in a push-up type of position being supported by your two extended arms in front of you. This will be your starting position.\n While keeping your back completely straight and the upper body stationary, pull your knees in towards your chest as you exhale, allowing the ball to roll forward under your ankles. Squeeze your abs and hold that position for a second.\n Now slowly straighten your legs, rolling the ball back to the starting position as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

The legs should be straight down with the pelvis rolled slightly backwards. This will be your starting position.\n Raise your legs until the torso makes a 90-degree angle with the legs. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second or so.\n Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Perform this exercise slowly and deliberately as it takes some getting used to. Also, do not be hasty and try to use weights on the first time; you'll have enough in your hands by holding your weight and also learning how to balance yourself so that you avoid swinging your torso. As you get more advanced you can hold a dumbbell in between your feet. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise as if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia.\n

This will be your starting position.\n Slowly roll the barbell straight forward, stretching your body into a straight position. Tip: Go down as far as you can without touching the floor with your body. Breathe in during this portion of the movement.\n After a second pause at the stretched position, start pulling yourself back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Go slowly and keep your abs tight at all times.\n\nCaution: This exercise is for advanced level athletes only. It is also not advised for people with lower back problems or hernias.\n

The chest should be up and the head facing forward. Adopt a hip-width stance with the feet turned out as needed.\n Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward. Ensure that they stay align with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as upright as possible.\n Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel. At the moment the upper legs contact the lower legs reverse the motion, driving the weight upward.\n

The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack.\n As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your lower chest.\n After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up).\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution:\n\n If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\n Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to touch your lower chest and nowhere else.\n Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.\n

Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward. This will be your starting position.\n Now, keeping the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.\n Then, inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

You should be looking straight forward, with your shoulders back, your spine straight, and your feet just outside of shoulder width. This will be your starting position.\n Initiate the movement by descending into a squat, flexing the hips and knees to lower your body. Maintain the angle of your torso, paying close attention to the preservation of your spine. As you descend, push your knees outward and keep your weight on your heels.\n Descend until you either reach the full squat position with your hamstrings on your calves or until your back starts to round. At the bottom of the motion pause briefly.\n Return to the starting position by driving through your heels, extending the knees and hips to return to the starting position. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.\n

Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.\n Begin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n Begin to raise your torso as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. You may use wrist wraps for this exercise.\n

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\n Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The front squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. This version of the squat is better suited for advanced athletes.\n

These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\n Grab the V-bar with the palms facing each other (a neutral grip). Stick your chest out and lean yourself back slightly (around 30-degrees) in order to better engage the lats. This will be your starting position.\n Using your lats, pull the bar down as you squeeze your shoulder blades. Continue until your chest nearly touches the V-bar. Exhale as you execute this motion. Tip: Keep the torso stationary throughout the movement.\n After a second hold on the contracted position, slowly bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe in.\n Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Avoid the temptation to use a weight so big that you need to start swinging your torso in order to perform the exercise.

The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the rope with the palms facing each other. This is your starting position.\n Using the triceps, bring the rope down as you bring each side of the rope to the side of your thighs. At the end of the movement the arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.\n After holding for a second, at the contracted position, bring the rope slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

Position the barbell at a height so that when seated on the flat bench, the arms must be almost fully extended to reach the barbell.\n Once you have the correct height, sit slightly in behind the barbell so that there is an imaginary straight line from the tip of your nose to the barbell. Your feet should be stationary. Grab the barbell with the palms facing forward, unlock it and lift it up so that your arms are fully extended. This is the starting position.\n Slowly begin to lower the barbell until it is level with your chin while inhaling.\n Then lift the barbell back to the starting position using your shoulders while exhaling.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariation: You can use dumbbells or a barbell to perform this exercise.

Tip: a better way is to have somebody hand it to you especially if it is very heavy. The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hand should be facing inward. This will be your starting position.\n Keeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semi-circular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.\n Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

The upper arm will be stationary by your torso and should be parallel to the floor (aligned with your torso at all times). This will be your starting position.\n As you breathe out, externally rotate your forearm so that the dumbbell is lifted up in a semicircle motion as you maintain the 90 degree angle bend between the upper arms and the forearm. You will continue this external rotation until the forearm is perpendicular to the floor and the torso pointing towards the ceiling. At this point you will hold the contraction for a second.\n As you breathe in, slowly go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then switch to the other arm.\n\nCaution: There is no need to go heavy with this exercise. Too much weight will cause rotator cuff injury.\n

Using a wide, pronated (palms forward) grip that is around 3 inches away from shoulder width (for each hand), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. The bar will be perpendicular to the torso and the floor. This will be your starting position.\n As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest.\n After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution:\n\n If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\n Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else.\n Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.\n

Make sure that you either place the other end of the barbell in the corner of two walls; or put a heavy object on the ground so the barbell cannot slide backward.\n Bend forward until your torso is as close to parallel with the floor as you can and keep your knees slightly bent.\n Now grab the bar with both arms just behind the plates on the side where the weight was placed and put your other hand on your knee. This will be your starting position.\n Pull the bar straight up with your elbows in (to maximize back stimulation) until the plates touch your lower chest. Squeeze the back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold for a second at the top of the movement. Breathe out as you lift the weight. Tip: Use a stirrup or double handle cable attachment by hooking it under the end of the bar.\n Slowly lower the bar to the starting position getting a nice stretch on the lats. Tip: Do not let the plates touch the floor. To ensure the best range of motion, I recommend using small plates (25-lb ones) as opposed to larger plates (like 35-45lb ones).\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

Make sure that your heels are resting comfortably against the base of the foot pedals and that the straps are secured. Select the program that you wish to use, if applicable. Sit up straight and bend forward at the hips.\n There are three phases of movement when using a rower. The first phase is when you come forward on the rower. Your knees are bent and against your chest. Your upper body is leaning slightly forward while still maintaining good posture.Next, push against the foot pedals and extend your legs while bringing your hands to your upper abdominal area, squeezing your shoulders back as you do so. To avoid straining your back, use primarily your leg and hip muscles.\n The recovery phase simply involves straightening your arms, bending the knees, and bringing your body forward again as you transition back into the first phase.\n

Tip: Preferably use a leg curl machine that is angled as opposed to flat since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment.\n Keeping the torso flat on the bench, ensure your legs are fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances described on the foot positioning section). This will be your starting position.\n As you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.\n As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Do not ever use so much weight on the exercise that you start using swinging and jerking as you can risk both lower back injury and also a hamstring injury.\n

To begin, first set the bar on a rack just below shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n Step away from the rack and step forward with your right leg and squat down through your hips, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: Do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. li>\n Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale.\n Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.\n\nCaution: This is a movement that requires a great deal of balance so if you suffer from balance problems you may wish to either avoid it or just use your own bodyweight while holding on to a fixed object. Definitely never perform with a barbell on your back if you suffer from balance issues.\n

Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\n Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\n As you have both arms extended in front of you - while holding the bar at the chosen grip width - bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.\n As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary (only the arms should move). The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull the bar down using the forearms.\n After a second in the contracted position, while squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.\n 6. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n

The elbows should be bent at a 90 degree angle.\n As you contract the triceps, extend your arms downwards as you exhale. Tip: At the bottom of the movement, focus on keeping a little bend in your arms to keep tension on the triceps muscle.\n Now slowly let your arms come back up to the starting position as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

Most ellipticals have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.\n The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity.\n\nEllipticals offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and have far less impact on joints than ground-based cardio such as running. A 150 lb person will burn on average 387 calories in 30 minutes, compared to more than 450-700 calories running. It’s recommended that you use the arms on the elliptical to create more movement, if your elliptical has them.

Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The weights should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.\n While keeping the torso stationary, lift the dumbbells to your side as you breathe out, squeezing your shoulder blades together. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.\n Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution:\n\n This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.\n Ensure perfect form and never round the back as this can cause back injury.\n Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\n

Hyperextensions With No Hyperextension Bench          | Isolation | Lower Back  | Body Only     | Strength              | Beginner     | 8.8 | Back extension                                | Exercise ball weighted hyperextension                 | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | With someone holding down your legs, slide yourself down to the edge a flat bench until your hips hang off the end of the bench. Tip: Your entire upper body should be hanging down towards the floor. Also, you will be in the same position as if you were on a hyperextension bench but the range of motion will be shorter due to the height of the flat bench vs. that of the hyperextension bench.\n With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms.\n Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you almost touch the floor or you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings (whichever comes first). Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise.\n Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you exhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

You can choose a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise.\n Pump your legs up and down in an established rhythm, driving the pedals down but not all the way to the floor. It is recommended that you maintain your grip on the handles so that you don’t fall. The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity.\n Stairmasters offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside. They are typically much harder than other cardio equipment. A 150 lb person will typically burn over 300 calories in 30 minutes, compared to about 175 calories walking.\n

Using a medium-width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over your neck with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.\n As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your neck.\n After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up).\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution:\n\n It is imperative that if you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\n For obvious reasons you need to be in full control of the barbell at all times.\n

This will be your starting position.\n Step backward with your right leg around two feet or so from the left foot and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Tip: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground. Keep the torso upright during the lunge; flexible hip flexors are important. A long lunge emphasizes the Gluteus Maximus; a short lunge emphasizes Quadriceps.\n Push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale. Tip: Use the ball of your feet to push in order to accentuate the quadriceps. To focus on the glutes, press with your heels.\n Now repeat with the opposite leg.\n
Seated Calf Raise                                     | Compound | Calves      | Machine       | Strength              | Intermediate | 8.7 | Dumbbell Seated One-Leg Calf Raise            | Barbell Seated Calf Raise                             | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Sit on the machine and place your toes on the lower portion of the platform provided with the heels extending off. Choose the toe positioning of your choice (forward, in, or out) as per the beginning of this chapter.\n Place your lower thighs under the lever pad, which will need to be adjusted according to the height of your thighs. Now place your hands on top of the lever pad in order to prevent it from slipping forward.\n Lift the lever slightly by pushing your heels up and release the safety bar. This will be your starting position.\n Slowly lower your heels by bending at the ankles until the calves are fully stretched. Inhale as you perform this movement.\n Raise the heels by extending the ankles as high as possible as you contract the calves and breathe out. Hold the top contraction for a second.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

(Note: In some leg press units you can leave the safety bars on for increased safety. If your leg press unit allows for this, then this is the preferred method of performing the exercise.) Your torso and the legs should make perfect 90-degree angle. Now carefully place your toes and balls of your feet on the lower portion of the platform with the heels extending off. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position.\n Press on the platform by raising your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.\n Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be very cautious as you place the feet in the bottom part of the platform as if you slip and the safety bars are not locked then you could suffer a serious accident.\n

With the bench perpendicular to your body, and while looking away from it, hold on to the bench on its edge with the hands fully extended, separated at shoulder width. The legs will be extended forward, bent at the waist and perpendicular to your torso. This will be your starting position.\n Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down.\n Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.\n Now, while keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause.\n Then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.\n\nAlso, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.\n\nBe cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\n

If you are resting your feet on a bench, place them three to four inches apart and point your toes inward so they touch.\n Now place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Don't lock your fingers behind your head.\n While pushing the small of your back down in the floor to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off the floor.\n Continue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the floor only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the floor. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using momentum.\n After the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

The elbows should be close to the torso and the palms of your hand should be facing your thighs.\n While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the right weight as you rotate the palm of the hands until they are facing forward. At this point continue contracting the biceps as you breathe out until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Tip: Only the forearms should move.\n Slowly begin to bring the dumbbell back to the starting position as your breathe in. Tip: Remember to twist the palms back to the starting position (facing your thighs) as you come down.\n Repeat the movement with the left hand. This equals one repetition.\n Continue alternating in this manner for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

This will be your starting position.\n Begin the movement by stepping up, putting your left foot on the top of the bench. Extend through the hip and knee of your front leg to stand up on the box. As you stand on the box with your left leg, flex your right knee and hip, bringing your knee as high as you can.\n Reverse this motion to step down off the box, and then repeat the sequence on the opposite leg.\n
Smith machine back squat                              | Isolation | Quadriceps  | Machine       | Strength              | Intermediate | 8.7 | Dumbbell squat                                | -                                                     | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | To begin, first set the bar on the height that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side (palms facing forward), unlock it and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with leg presses instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\n

The dumbbells should be resting on top of your thighs. Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your back should be straight. This will be your starting position.\n Use your side shoulders to lift the dumbbells as you exhale. The dumbbells should be close to the body as you move it up and the elbows should drive the motion. Continue to lift them until they nearly touch your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbells, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.\n Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.\n

For long bands, they will need to be anchored to a secure base, such as heavy dumbbells or a rack. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Ensure that the bands are under the back half of your foot (for short bands), directly where you are driving into the floor. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets.2. With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.\n Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.\n

Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart outside knees with elbows fully extended.\n Place the bar about 1 inch in front of your shins and over the balls of your feet.\n Your back should be flat or slightly arched, your chest held up and out and your shoulder blades should be retracted.\n Keep your head in a neutral position (in line with vertebral column and not tilted or rotated) with your eyes focused straight ahead. Inhale during this phase.\n\nPhase 2: First Pull Phase\n\n Lift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale. Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle. Do not bend at the waist yet and do not let the hips rise before the shoulders (this would have the effect of pushing the glutes in the air and stretching the hamstrings.\n Keep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the shoulders over the bar.\n As the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible.\n\nPhase 3: Transition or Scoop Phase\n\n As the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them. Tip: At this point your thighs should be against the bar.\n Keep the back flat or slightly arched, elbows fully extended and your head neutral. Tip: You will hold your breath until the next phase.\n\nPhase 4: Second Pull Phase\n\n Inhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes.\n Keep the bar as close to your body as possible. Tip: Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position. Also, keep your shoulders over the bar and arms straight as long as possible.\n When your lower body joints are fully extended, shrug the shoulders upward rapidly without letting the elbows flex yet. Exhale during this portion of the movement.\n As the shoulders reach their highest elevation flex your elbows to begin pulling your body under the bar.\n Continue to pull the arms as high and as long as possible. Tip: Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.\n\nPhase 5: Catch Phase\n\n After the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar.\n Simultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position.\n Once the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles.\n Catch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement.\n Stand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.\n\nPhase 6: Downward Movement Phase\n\n Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement.\n Simultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs.\n Squat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor.\n Start over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place it on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck).\n Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance. Also maintain a straight back and keep the knees with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position.\n Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending (other than the slight initial bend we created during positioning) at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.\n Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.\n Now lift your toes by contracting the tibia muscles in the front of the calves as you breathe out.\n Hold for a second and bring them back down as you breathe in.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury. Also, choose a conservative weight. This exercise requires a lot of balance and choosing too much weight may cause you to lose balance and fall.\n

Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\n Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\n As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.\n As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.\n After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.\n Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n

This will be your starting position.\n While maintaining the torso in a stationary position (no swinging), lift the dumbbells to your side with a slight bend on the elbow and the hands slightly tilted forward as if pouring water in a glass. Continue to go up until you arms are parallel to the floor. Exhale as you execute this movement and pause for a second at the top.\n Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariation: This exercise can also be performed sitting down.

First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg (just above your feet). Also, make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.\n Using your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position.\n Slowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of times.\n

Have a barbell in front of you on the floor. Tip: Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other.\n Bend the knees and use a pronated grip with your hands being wider than shoulder width apart from each other to lift the barbell up until you can rest it on your chest.\n Then lift the barbell over your head and rest it on the base of your neck. Move one foot back so that your toe is resting on the flat bench. Your other foot should be stationary in front of you. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. Tip: Make sure your back is straight and chest is out while performing this exercise.\n As you inhale, slowly lower your leg until your thigh is parallel to the floor. At this point, your knee should be over your toes. Your chest should be directly above the middle of your thigh.\n Leading with the chest and hips and contracting the quadriceps, elevate your leg back to the starting position as you exhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n Switch legs and repeat the movement.\n

Adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\n Grab the pull-down bar with the palms facing your torso (a supinated grip). Make sure that the hands are placed closer than the shoulder width.\n As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.\n As you breathe out, pull the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the fully contracted position and keep the elbows close to your body. The upper torso should remain stationary as your bring the bar to you and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\n After a second on the contracted position, while breathing in, slowly bring the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.\n Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n

Grab the cable bar at shoulder width and keep the elbows close to the torso. The palm of your hands should be facing up (supinated grip). This will be your starting position.\n While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the muscle.\n Slowly begin to bring the curl bar back to starting position as your breathe in.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariation: You can also perform this movement using an E-Z barbell attachment or single handles.

Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lat as you hold the bar in front of you. The right arm can be kept by the waist. This is the starting position of the exercise.\n Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it as you rotate the wrist, so that by the time your hand is by your abdominals it is in a neutral position (palms facing the torso). Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard.\n Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. Tip: Remember to rotate the wrist as you go back to the starting position so that the palms are facing down again.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the right hand.\n

Use the hand you are not lifting with to help position the dumbbell over you properly.\n Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrist forward so that the palm of your hand is facing away from you. This will be your starting position.\n Bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe in. Keep full control of the dumbbell at all times. Tip: Use the hand that you are not lifting with to help keep the dumbbell balance as you may struggle a bit at first. Only use your non-lifting hand if it is needed. Otherwise, keep it resting to the side.\n As you breathe out, push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.\n Switch arms and repeat the movement.\n\nCaution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbell next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.\n\nJust lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrist so that you can place the dumbbell on top of your thigh. When the dumbbell is touching your thigh simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbell on your thigh) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbell on top of the thigh). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with the dumbbell still on top of your thigh. At this moment you can place the dumbbell on the floor.

Your back should be straight and inclined slightly forward.\n Begin by aggressively extending through the hips, knees and ankles, driving the weight upward. As you do so, shrug your shoulders towards your ears. As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out.\n At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.\n Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up.

Tip: Keep the arm parallel to your torso.\n Now bend the elbow while keeping the upper arm stationary. In this manner, the forearm will be parallel to the floor and perpendicular to your torso (Tip: So the forearm will be directly in front of you). The upper arm will be stationary by your torso and should be parallel to the floor (aligned with your torso at all times). This will be your starting position.\n As you breathe out, externally rotate your forearm so that the dumbbell is lifted up in a semicircle motion as you maintain the 90 degree angle bend between the upper arms and the forearm. You will continue this external rotation until the forearm is perpendicular to the floor and the torso pointing towards the ceiling. At this point you will hold the contraction for a second.\n As you breathe in, slowly go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then switch to the other arm.\n\nCaution: There is no need to go heavy with this exercise. Too much weight will cause rotator cuff injury.\n

Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.\n\n Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\n\n Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\n\n As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.\n\n Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.\n

Position your legs so they are secure on the extension of the abdominal bench. This is the starting position.\n While inhaling, tighten your abdominals and glutes. Simultaneously curl your torso as you do when performing a sit-up and press the barbell to an overhead position while exhaling. Tip: Use your arms to push the barbell out as you perform this exercise while still focusing on the abdominal muscles.\n Lower your upper body back down to the starting position while bringing the barbell back down to your torso. Remember to breathe in while lowering the body.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: It is best to have a spotter while performing this exercise so that it is easier to get the barbell and also get rid of it. Also, always start with an empty bar and do not use jerking motions at any time.\n
Barbell rear delt bent-over row                       | Isolation | Shoulders   | Barbell       | Strength              | Intermediate | 8.5 | Cable Seated Lateral Raise                    | Head-on-bench dumbbell rear delt raise                | Reverse Flyes With External Rotation                | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Stand up straight while holding a barbell using a wide (higher than shoulder width) and overhand (palms facing your body) grip.\n Bend knees slightly and bend over as you keep the natural arch of your back. Let the arms hang in front of you as they hold the bar. Once your torso is parallel to the floor, flare the elbows out and away from your body. Tip: Your torso and your arms should resemble the letter "T". Now you are ready to begin the exercise.\n While keeping the upper arms perpendicular to the torso, pull the barbell up towards your upper chest as you squeeze the rear delts and you breathe out. Tip: When performed correctly, this exercise should resemble a bench press in reverse. Also, refrain from using your biceps to do the work. Focus on targeting the rear delts; the arms should only act as hooks.\n Slowly go back to the initial position as you breathe in.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

Your rear end should be close to the floor without touching it.\n With both hands, reach back and grab the handle of each cable.\n With your feet positioned in a wide stance, extend your arms straight out in front of you and in between your knees. Your hands should be at knee level.\n Keep your arms straight and in-line with the upward angle of the cable. Elevate your torso in a crunching motion without dropping or bending your arms.\n Maintain the rigid position with your arms. Slowly descend back to the starting position with your back arched around the Bosu Ball and your abdominals elongated.\n Repeat the same series of movements to failure.\n Once you reach failure, keep your abs tight and raise your torso into plank position so your back is elevated off the Bosu Ball.\n Lower your arms down to your side; keep them straight. Start doing alternating side bends; reach for your heels! This finishing movement will focus on your obliques.\n\nTip: Arch your back around the Bosu Ball before each rep to fully elongate your abdominals. This will provide a full range of motion and lengthen your muscle fibers, giving them a much fuller appearance.

Leverage Chest Press                                  | Isolation | Chest       | Machine       | Strength              | Beginner     | 8.5 | -                                             | -                                                     | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Load an appropriate weight onto the pins and adjust the seat for your height. The handles should be near the bottom or middle of the pectorals at the beginning of the motion.\n Your chest and head should be up and your shoulder blades retracted. This will be your starting position.\n Press the handles forward by extending through the elbow.\n After a brief pause at the top, return the weight just above the start position, keeping tension on the muscles by not returning the weight to the stops until the set is complete.\n
Gironda Sternum Chins                                 | Isolation | Lats        | Other         | Strength              | Beginner     | 8.5 | Reverse-grip lat pull-down                    | V-bar pull-up                                         | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Grasp the pull-up bar with a shoulder width underhand grip.\n Now hang with your arms fully extended and stick your chest out and lean back. Tip: You will be leaning back throughout the entire movement. This will be your starting position.\n Start pulling yourself towards the bar with your spine arched throughout the movement and your head leaning back as far away from the bar as possible. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: At the upper end of the movement, your hips and legs will be at about a 45-degree angle to the floor.\n Keep pulling until your collarbone passes the bar and your lower chest or sternum area touches it. Hold that contraction for a second. Tip: By the time you've completed this portion of the movement; your head will be parallel to the floor.\n Slowly start going back to the starting position as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n
Exercise ball crunch                                  | Compound  | Abdominals  | Exercise Ball | Strength              | Intermediate | 8.4 | Crunch - Hands Overhead                       | -                                                     | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Lie on an exercise ball with your lower back curvature pressed against the spherical surface of the ball. Your feet should be bent at the knee and pressed firmly against the floor. The upper torso should be hanging off the top of the ball. The arms should either be kept alongside the body or crossed on top of your chest as these positions avoid neck strains (as opposed to the hands behind the back of the head position).\n Lower your torso into a stretch position keeping the neck stationary at all times. This will be your starting position.\n With the hips stationary, flex the waist by contracting the abdominals and curl the shoulders and trunk upward until you feel a nice contraction on your abdominals. The arms should simply slide up the side of your legs if you have them at the side or just stay on top of your chest if you have them crossed. The lower back should always stay in contact with the ball. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second.\n As you inhale, go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Perform this exercise slowly and deliberately as it takes some getting used to. Also, do not be hasty and try to use weights on the first time; you'll have enough on your hands learning how to balance yourself. Also, if balance is an issue I recommend having a spotter next to you and also placing each of your feet under a 100-lb dumbbell for added stability. As you get more advanced you can hold a dumbbell or a weight plate (held at arms length) on top of your chest. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise, because if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia.\n

The palms of your hands should be facing each other as you pick them. This will be your starting position.\n Keeping your torso forward and stationary, and the arms slightly bent at the elbows, lift the dumbbells straight to the side until both arms are parallel to the floor. Exhale as you lift the weights. (Note: avoid swinging the torso or bringing the arms back as opposed to the side.)\n After a one second contraction at the top, slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariation: This exercise can also be performed standing but those with lower back problems are better off performing this seated variety.

Tip: Keep your head up at all times and also maintain the back on the pad at all times.\n Place your arms on the side handles of the machine and disengage the safety bars (which on most designs is done by moving the side handles from a facing front position to a diagonal position).\n Now straighten your legs without locking the knees. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n Begin to slowly lower the unit by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up (back on the pad at all times). Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n Begin to raise the unit as you exhale by pushing the floor with mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

Your arms should be fully extended at a 90-degree angle from your torso and the floor. The palms should be facing in and the elbows should be tucked in. This is the starting position.\n As you breathe in and you keep the upper arms stationary with the elbows in, slowly lower the weight until the dumbbells are near your ears.\n At that point, while keeping the elbows in and the upper arms stationary, use the triceps to bring the weight back up to the starting position as you breathe out.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is an exercise that you need to be very careful with when selecting the weight. Too much weight with sloppy form and you could be looking at injured elbows. Also, if you suffer from elbow problems this exercise might be too harsh on your elbows, so you may need to look for a substitute such as a close-grip bench press.\n\nVariation: You can perform this exercise in an alternate fashion like alternate dumbbell curls.

Keeping your back flat, bend forward and squat down, grasping the dumbbells. This is your start position.\n Initiate the movement by kicking one leg back, then the other so that you’re in the push-up position, holding onto the dumbbells. Your weight should be on your toes and hands. Do a one-arm row for each side, bringing your elbow up as high as you can.\n Hop your feet forward and rise up by cleaning the weights, bringing them up to shoulder level, palms facing forward as you hop a second time. Descend into a squat and explosively rise up, then press the weights overhead to full arm extension.\n Lower the dumbbells back to your shoulders, then bend over as you squat down to return the weights back to the floor in front of you. Repeat for reps.\n

Hips should be below the bench and legs bent with feet firmly on the floor. The head will be off the bench as well.\n\n Grasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest at arms length. Both palms should be pressing against the underside one of the sides of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position.\n\n Caution: Always ensure that the dumbbell used for this exercise is secure. Using a dumbbell with loose plates can result in the dumbbell falling apart and falling on your face.\n\n While keeping your arms straight, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest.\n\n At that point, bring the dumbbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement.\n\n Hold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions.\n\nCaution: If you are new to this movement, have a spotter hand you the weight instead. If not, please ensure that the dumbbell does not fall on you as you arrange your torso to perform the exercise on the bench. Also, as I already mentioned, ensure that the dumbbell used is in perfect working condition. Old dumbbells in need of welding should never be used to perform this exercise.\n

It requires relatively good balance and coordination. It is necessary to learn the basics of skating including turning and stopping and to wear protective gear to avoid possible injury.\n You can skate at a comfortable pace for 30 minutes straight. If you want a cardio challenge, do interval skating – speed skate two minutes of every five minutes, using the remaining three minutes to recover. A 150 lb person will typically burn about 175 calories in 30 minutes skating at a comfortable pace, similar to brisk walking.\n

This is your starting position.\n Pull your torso up while leaning to the left hand side until the bar almost touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space (no swinging) and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\n After a second of contraction, inhale as you go back to the starting position.\n Now, pull your torso up while leaning to the right hand side until the bar almost touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\n After a second of contraction, inhale as you go back to the starting position.\n Repeat steps 3-6 until you have performed the prescribed amount of repetitions for each side.\n\nCaution: If you are new to this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, using a spotter to hold your legs can help being that it requires putting a lot of stress on the rotator cuffs. Alternatively you can also use a chin assist machine.\n

Keep your elbows flared out with the upper arms in line with the shoulders (perpendicular to the torso) and the elbows bent creating a 90-degree angle between the upper arm and the forearm. This will be your starting position.\n Now bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe in. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times.\n As you breathe out, push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n When you are done, place the dumbbells back in your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to dispose of the dumbbells.\n

Make sure to keep your feet on the floor.\n Use your arms to grab both of the dumbbells and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against your thighs with the palms of the hands facing down. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge of your thighs.\n Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling.\n Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling. Make sure to inhale during this part of the exercise. Tip: Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n When finished, simply lower the dumbbells to the floor.\n

This is your starting position.\n As you use one arm to hold yourself, bend at the knees and slowly lower your torso toward the ground by bringing your pelvis and knees forward. Inhale as you go down and stop when your upper and lower legs almost create a 90-degree angle. Hold the stretch position for a second.\n After your one second hold, use your thigh muscles to bring your torso back up to the starting position. Exhale as you move up.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of times.\n\nCaution: This exercise is to be avoided if you suffer from knee problems as it can stress the knee. Also, make sure that there is nothing behind you; as in the case that you lose your balance and fall, that way nothing will hit you on the head causing an injury.\n

This will be your starting position. Tip: The dumbbell should be next to your thighs with the palm of your hands facing back.\n Use your side shoulders to lift the dumbbells as you exhale. The dumbbells should be to the side of the body as you move them up. Continue to lift it until the dumbbells are nearly in line with your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbell, your elbow should always be higher than your forearm. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.\n Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from this movement and substitute by some form of lateral raises.\n

Your arm should be perpendicular to your body. The palm of your hand should be facing towards your face as a supinated grip is required to perform this exercise.\n Place your non lifting hand on your bicep for support.\n Slowly begin to lower the dumbbell down as you breathe in.\n Then, begin lifting the dumbbell upward as you contract the triceps. Remember to breathe out during the concentric (lifting part of the exercise).\n Repeat until you have performed your set repetitions.\n Switch arms and repeat the movement.\n Switch arms again and repeat the movement.\n\nCaution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbell next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.\n\nJust lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrist so that you can place the dumbbell on top of your thigh. When the dumbbell is touching your thigh simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbell on your thigh) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbell on top of the thigh). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with the dumbbell still on top of your thigh. At this moment you can place the dumbbell on the floor.

Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The weights should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.\n While keeping the torso stationary, lift the dumbbells to your side (as you breathe out), keeping the elbows close to the body (do not exert any force with the forearm other than holding the weights). On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.\n Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution:\n\n This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.\n Ensure perfect form and never round the back as this can promote back injury.\n Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\n

Rest the bar on top of the front deltoids, pushing into the clavicles, and lightly touching the throat. Your hands should be in a clean grip, touching the bar only with your fingers to help keep it in position.\n To unrack the bar, push upward into it and push your hips forward. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head and elbows up at all times. Your triceps should remain parallel with the ground. Keep a neutral neck and flat back. This will be your starting position.\n Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt back. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\n As you prepare to ascend, push through your heels and begin to wrap your fingers tightly around the bar for a firm grip. As you near the top of your squat, begin pressing the bar up towards the ceiling, allowing your neck to hyperextend so that the bar has room to move.\n A final position will be one in which your arms are fully extended overhead and your legs straight.

Most treadmills have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.\n Treadmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than jogging outside. A 150 lb person will burn almost 250 calories jogging for 30 minutes, compared to more than 450 calories running. Maintain proper posture as you jog, and only hold onto the handles when necessary, such as when dismounting or checking your heart rate.\n

Using a close, supinated grip (around shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked extended in front of you and perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position.\n As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that as opposed to a regular bench press, you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement.\n After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall around the area between the sternum and upper abs.\n\nVariation: This exercise can also be performed with an e-z bar using the inner handle as well as dumbbells.

Once you cannot go down any further, lock your upper arms in that position and that will be your starting position.\n As you breathe out, slowly begin to curl the weights up as you simultaneously rotate your wrists so that the palms of the hands face up. Continue curling the weight until your biceps are fully contracted and squeeze hard at the top position for a second. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Upper arms should remain stationary and elbows should stay in throughout the movement.\n Return back to the starting position very slowly.\n\nCaution: It is very important to use a weight that you can control throughout the movement and also to start with a slight bend in your elbows. It is very easy to injure the biceps tendon if improper form and or too much weight is used.

Hips should be below the bench and legs bent with feet firmly on the floor. The head will be off the bench as well.\n Grasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest with a bend in your arms. Both palms should be pressing against the underside one of the sides of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position. Caution: Always ensure that the dumbbell used for this exercise is secure. Using a dumbbell with loose plates can result in the dumbbell falling apart and falling on your face.\n While keeping your arms locked in the bent arm position, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest.\n At that point, bring the dumbbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement.\n Hold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions.\n\nCaution: If you are new to this movement, have a spotter hand you the weight instead. If not, please ensure that the dumbbell does not fall on you as you arrange your torso to perform the exercise on the bench.\n\nAlso, as I already mentioned, ensure that the dumbbell used is in perfect working condition. Old dumbbells in need of welding should never be used to perform this exercise.\n

Standing barbell calf raise                           | Isolation | Calves      | Barbell       | Strength              | Beginner     | 8.2 | Calf Press On The Leg Press Machine           | Weighted donkey calf raise                            | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the bar on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck).\n Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Tip: For better range of motion you may also place the ball of your feet on a wooden block but be careful as this option requires more balance and a sturdy block.\n Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.\n Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury.\n

Most treadmills have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.\n Treadmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than walking outside. When walking, you should move at a moderate to fast pace, not a leisurely one. Being an activity of lower intensity, walking doesn’t burn as many calories as some other activities, but still provides great benefit. A 150 lb person will burn about 175 calories walking 4 miles per hour for 30 minutes, compared to 450 calories running twice as fast. Maintain proper posture as you walk, and only hold onto the handles when necessary, such as when dismounting or checking your heart rate.\n

Continue this movement until you raise your hips off of the floor by rolling your pelvis backward. Breathe out as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: At the end of the movement your knees will be over your chest.\n Squeeze your abs at the top of the movement for a second and then return to the starting position slowly as you breathe in. Tip: Maintain a controlled motion at all times.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n
Cable overhead triceps extension                      | Isolation | Triceps     | Cable         | Strength              | Intermediate | 8.1 | Kneeling cable triceps extension              | Decline EZ-bar skullcrusher                           | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Attach a rope to the bottom pulley of the pulley machine.\n Grasping the rope with both hands, extend your arms with your hands directly above your head using a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Your elbows should be in close to your head and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor with the knuckles aimed at the ceiling. This will be your starting position.\n Slowly lower the rope behind your head as you hold the upper arms stationary. Inhale as you perform this movement and pause when your triceps are fully stretched.\n Return to the starting position by flexing your triceps as you breathe out.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n
Smith machine bent-over row                           | Compound  | Middle Back | Machine       | Strength              | Intermediate | 8.1 | One-Arm Dumbbell Row                          | Bent Over Barbell Row                                 | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Set the barbell attached to the smith machine to a height that is about 2 inches below your knees.\n Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up.\n Now grasp the barbell using an overhand (pronated) grip and unlock it from the smith machine rack. Then let it hang directly in front of you as your arms hang extended perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.\n While keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.\n Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution:\n\n This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.\n Also, just like with the bent knee deadlift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.\n Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\n

Hold your hands in front of you, palms down with your fingertips together at chest height. This will be your starting position.\n Rapidly dip down into a quarter squat and immediately explode upward. Drive the knees towards the chest, attempting to touch them to the palms of the hands.\n Jump as high as you can, raising your knees up, and then ensure a good land be re-extending your legs, absorbing impact through be allowing the knees to rebend.\n
Cable straight-bar upright row                        | Compound  | Traps       | Cable         | Strength              | Intermediate | 8.1 | Smith machine upright row                     | Upright Row - With Bands                              | Barbell upright row                                 | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Grasp a straight bar cable attachment that is attached to a low pulley with a pronated (palms facing your thighs) grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The bar should be resting on top of your thighs. Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your back should be straight. This will be your starting position.\n Use your side shoulders to lift the cable bar as you exhale. The bar should be close to the body as you move it up. Continue to lift it until it nearly touches your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the bar, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.\n Lower the bar back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.\n

The pins should be set at an appropriate height. Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders, not on top of your traps. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders.\n Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back. Keep your head facing forward. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. This will be your starting position.\n Keeping the bar tight, bend forward at the hips as much as possible. If you set the pins to what would be parallel, you not only have a safety if you fail, but know when to stop.\n Pause just above the pins and reverse the motion until your torso it upright.\n

Hips should be below the bench and your legs bent with your feet firmly on the floor.\n Grasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest at arm’s length. Both palms should be pressing against the underside of the sides of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position.\n Initiate the movement by lowering the dumbbell to your chest.\n Return to the starting position by extending the elbows.\n
Zercher squat                                         | Compound  | Quadriceps  | Barbell       | Strength              | Intermediate | 8.1 | -                                             | -                                                     | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. The correct height should be anywhere above the waist but below the chest. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, lock your hands together and place the bar on top of your arms in between the forearm and upper arm.\n Lift the bar up so that it is resting on top of your forearms. If you are holding the bar properly, it should look as if you have your arms crossed but with a bar running across them.\n Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the ball of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This exercise is not to be taken lightly as you are applying a lot of pressure to your arms when lifting the barbell. It is always a good idea to have a spotter as they can help you keep proper form. Also, make sure that your back is kept straight as bending it can cause an injury.
Full Range-Of-Motion Lat Pulldown                     | Compound  | Lats        | Cable         | Strength              | Beginner     | 8.1 | Lat pull-down                                 | Close-grip pull-down                                  | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Either standing or seated on a high bench, grasp two stirrup cables that are attached to the high pulleys. Grab with the opposing hand so your arms are crisscrossed about you and your palms are facing forward.\n Keeping your chest up and maintaining a slight arch in your lower back, pull the handles down as if you were doing a regular pulldown. The range of motion will be more of an arc. During the movement, rotate your hands so that in the bottom position your palms face each other rather than forward. Return slowly to the starting position and repeat.\n

Grasp the cables and hold them at shoulder height, palms facing forward. This will be your starting position.\n Keeping your head and chest up, extend through the elbow to press the handles directly over head.\n After pausing at the top, return to the starting position and repeat.\n
Cable Russian Twists                                  | Isolation | Abdominals  | Cable         | Strength              | Beginner     | 8.1 | -                                             | -                                                     | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Connect a standard handle attachment, and position the cable to a middle pulley position.\n Lie on a stability ball perpendicular to the cable and grab the handle with one hand. You should be approximately arm’s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable.\n Grab the handle with both hands and fully extend your arms above your chest. You hands should be directly in-line with the pulley. If not, adjust the pulley up or down until they are.\n Keep your hips elevated and abs engaged. Rotate your torso away from the pulley for a full-quarter rotation. Your body should be flat from head to knees.\n Pause for a moment and in a slow and controlled manner reset to the starting position. You should still have side tension on the cable in the resting position.\n Repeat the same movement to failure.\n Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.\n\nTip: It’s extremely important to keep your hips elevated during this exercise. If you do it correctly, your upper back will be on the ball, but your lower back and rear-end will be completely unsupported. Keeping your hips elevated will engage your core (lower back and abdominals), and make the exercise more effective.
Stiff Leg Barbell Good Morning                        | Compound  | Lower Back  | Barbell       | Strength              | Beginner     | 8.1 | -                                             | -                                                     | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.\n Keeping your legs stationary, move your torso forward by bending at the hips while inhaling. Lower your torso until it is parallel with the floor.\n Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by elevating your torso back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The stiff-legged barbell good morning is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.

Tip: If you are holding a barbell grab it using a shoulder-width grip and if you are using an E-Z Bar grab it on the inner handles.\n Extend your arms in front of you as you hold the barbell over your chest. The arms should be perpendicular to your torso (90-degree angle). This will be your starting position.\n As you inhale, lower the bar in a semi-circular motion by bending at the elbows and while keeping the upper arm stationary and elbows in. Keep lowering the bar until it lightly touches your chin.\n As you exhale bring the bar back up to the starting position by pushing the bar up in a semi-circular motion. Contract the triceps hard at the top of the movement for a second. Tip: Again, only the forearms should move. The upper arms should remain stationary at all times.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariation: You can use dumbbells to make the exercise more challenging.

The palms of your hand will be facing each other.\n By using your thighs to help you get the dumbbells up, clean the dumbbells one arm at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width. Note: when holding the dumbbells in front of you, make sure your arms are wider than shoulder width apart from each other using a pronated (palms forward) grip. Allow your elbows to point out. This is your starting position.\n Keeping the upper arms stationary, slowly move the dumbbells in and down in a semi circular motion until they touch the upper chest while inhaling. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times and do not move the upper arms nor rest the dumbbells on the chest.\n As you breathe out, move the dumbbells up using your triceps and the same semi-circular motion but in reverse. Attempt to keep the dumbbells together as they move up. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down again slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.\n\nCaution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.\n\nJust lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor.

Place the barbell at a height that you can reach when lying down and your arms are almost fully extended. Once the weight you need is selected, lie down on the flat bench. Using a close and pronated grip (palms facing forward) that is around shoulder width, unlock the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.\n As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that as opposed to a regular bench press, you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement.\n After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\n Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n When you are done, lock the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter as this exercise can be a bit challenging. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\n

Make sure that the knees do not go past the toes. The angle created between the hamstrings and the calves should be one that is slightly less than 90 degrees (since your starting position requires you to start slightly below parallel). Your back and your head should be resting on the machine while your shoulders are pressed under the shoulder pads.\n Place your hands by the handles and position your feet slightly pointing out at a shoulder width position. This will be your starting position.\n While pressing with the balls of the feet as you breathe out, make your whole body erect as you squeeze the quads. Hold the contracted position for a second. Tip: Since you are starting below parallel, you can opt to use your hands to help you up by pressing on your thighs only on the first repetition.\n Slowly squat down as you inhale but instead of going all the way down to the starting position, just stop once your thighs are parallel to the platform. The angle between your hamstrings and calves should be a 90-degree angle.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Keep your lower back and head pressed against the machine at all times.\n

Then grasp the side handles on the machine as you point your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances) and ensure that the legs are fully straight right in front of you. This will be your starting position.\n As you exhale, pull the machine lever as far as possible to the back of your thighs by flexing at the knees. Keep your torso stationary at all times. Hold the contracted position for a second.\n Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Do not ever use so much weight on the exercise that you start using swinging and jerking as you can risk both lower back injury and also a hamstring tear.\n

Attempt to keep the ends of the chains away from the plates so you don't hit them when you lower the weight.\n Begin with a bar loaded on the ground. Approach the bar so that the bar intersects the middle of the feet. The feet should be set very wide, near the collars. Bend at the hips to grip the bar. The arms should be directly below the shoulders, inside the legs, and you can use a pronated grip, a mixed grip, or hook grip. Relax the shoulders, which in effect lengthens your arms.\n Take a breath, and then lower your hips, looking forward with your head with your chest up. Drive through the floor, spreading your feet apart, with your weight on the back half of your feet. Extend through the hips and knees.\n As the bar passes through the knees, lean back and drive the hips into the bar, pulling your shoulder blades together.\n Return the weight to the ground by bending at the hips and controlling the weight on the way down.\n

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n Begin to raise the bar as fast as possible without involving momentum as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Note: You should perform these exercises as fast as possible but without breaking perfect form and without involving momentum.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly due to the speed that it requires. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

Begin with the dumbbell between your feet, and grip the handle with both hands.\n Clean the dumbbell by extending through your hips and knees to deliver the implement to the desired shoulder, letting go with the extra hand.\n Ensure that you get one of the dumbbell heads behind the shoulder to keep from being thrown off balance. To raise it overhead, dip by flexing the knees, and the drive upwards as you extend the dumbbell overhead, leaning slightly away from it as you do so.\n Carefully guide the bell back to the floor, keeping it under control as much as possible. It is best to perform this event on a thick rubber mat to prevent damage to the floor.\n

This will be your starting position.\n As you strongly tighten your glutes and hamstrings, fill your lungs with air and in a slow (three to six second count) ascent, slowly exhale. Tip: It is important to tighten the glutes and hamstrings as this will cause the hip flexors to be inactivated in a process called reciprocal inhibition, which basically means that opposite muscles to the contracted ones will relax.\n As you inhale, slowly go back in a controlled manner to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

The sled should provide enough resistance to require effort, but not so heavy that you are significantly slowed down.\n You may use the upright or the low handles for this exercise. Place your hands on the handles with your arms extended, leaning into the implement.\n With good posture, drive through the ground with alternating, short steps. Move as fast as you can for a short distance.\n

Barbell Squat To A Bench                              | Compound  | Quadriceps  | Barbell       | Strength              | Intermediate | 7.4 | -                                             | -                                                     | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first place a flat bench or a box behind you. The flat bench is used to teach you to set your hips back and to hit depth.\n\n Then, set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n\n Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n\n Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n\n Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting your hips back as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n\n Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.\n\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\n

The elbows should be close to the torso. Your legs should be at about shoulder's width apart from each other.\n Rotate the palms of the hands so that they are facing inward in a neutral position. This will be your starting position.\n While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights out while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Your wrist should turn so that when the weights are fully elevated you have supinated grip (palms facing up).\n Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Tip: Keep the forearms aligned with your outer deltoids.\n Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.\n Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to the starting position as your breathe in. Remember to rotate the wrists as you lower the weight in order to switch back to a neutral grip.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, grasp the bar using a pronated (palms forward) grip that is shoulder width apart. You may need some wrist wraps if using a significant amount of weight.\n Lift the barbell up and fully extend your arms with your back straight. There should be a slight bend at the elbows. This is the starting position.\n Use your side shoulders to lift the bar as you exhale. The bar should be close to the body as you move it up. Continue to lift it until it nearly touches your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the bar, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.\n Lower the bar back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.\n

Continue until your upper arm is parallel to the floor.\n After a brief pause, return the weight to the starting position.\n Repeat for the desired number of repetitions before engaging the hooks to rack the weight.\n
Weighted Squat                                        | Compound  | Quadriceps  | Other         | Strength              | Beginner     | 7.2 | Dumbbell sumo squat                           | Dumbbell squat                                        | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Start by positioning two flat benches shoulder width apart from each other. Stand on top of them and wrap the weighted belt around your waist with the amount of weight you feel comfortable with. Make sure your toes are facing out.\n Once you are standing straight up with the weight hanging in between your legs, position your arms so that they are fully extended to the side of your body. This is the starting position.\n Begin by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that are perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n Begin to move the body back up by pushing the floor of the flat bench with the ball of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Exhale as you perform this portion of the exercise.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

Use a pronated grip (palms facing down) and make sure your fingers grab the rough side of the plate while your thumb grabs the smooth side. Note: For the best results, grab the weighted plate at an 11:00 and 1:00 o'clock position.\n Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other and the weighted plate should be near the groin area. This is the starting position.\n Slowly lift the plate up while keeping the elbows in and the upper arms stationary until your biceps and forearms touch while exhaling. The plate should be evenly aligned with your torso at this point.\n Feel the contraction for a second and begin to lower the weight back down to the starting position while inhaling\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n

Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.\n Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight and elbows out. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\n Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended. Full extension should be violent and abrupt, and ensure that you do not prolong the extension for longer than necessary.\n

Your torso and your arms should make a 90-degree angle and the elbows should be in. This will be your starting position.\n As you breathe out, curl the bar down in a semicircular motion until it touches your chin. Squeeze the biceps for a second at the top contracted position. Tip: As you execute this motion only the forearms should move. At no time should the upper arms be moving at all. They are to remain perpendicular throughout the movement.\n Return to starting position slowly.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n
Behind-the-neck pull-down                             | Compound  | Lats        | Cable         | Strength              | Intermediate | 7.1 | Pullups                                       | Wide-Grip Rear Pull-Up                                | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\n Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\n As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso and head forward. Think of an imaginary line from the center of the bar down to the back of your neck. This is your starting position.\n As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches the back of your neck by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.\n After a second on the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.\n Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Performing this exercise can be hard on the rotator cuffs and if not properly executed can cause an injury to occur. Also, if you already have rotator cuff issues, I advise you to stick to the front pull-down version.\n

Tip: Your hands should be open with the palms together and fingers facing forward (perpendicular to your torso).\n Push both hands against each other as you contract your chest. Start with slow tension and increase slowly. Keep breathing normally as you execute this contraction.\n Hold for the recommended number of seconds.\n Now release the tension slowly.\n Rest for the recommended amount of time and repeat.\n

Dumbbell Squat To A Bench                             | Compound  | Quadriceps  | Dumbbell      | Strength              | Beginner     | 7   | -                                             | -                                                     | -                                                   | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | Stand up straight with a flat bench behind you while holding a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing the side of your legs).\n Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.\n Begin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. You may use wrist wraps for this exercise.\n

They also allow you to train a desired range of motion.\n The bench should be set up in a power rack. Set the pins to the desired point in your range of motion, whether it just be lockout or an inch off of your chest. The bar should be moved to the pins and prepared for lifting.\n Begin by lying on the bench, with the bar directly above the contact point during your regular bench. Tuck your feet underneath you and arch your back. Using the bar to help support your weight, lift your shoulder off the bench and retract them, squeezing the shoulder blades together. Use your feet to drive your traps into the bench. Maintain this tight body position throughout the movement.\n You can take a standard bench grip, or shoulder width to focus on the triceps. The bar, wrist, and elbow should stay in line at all times. Focus on squeezing the bar and trying to pull it apart.\n Drive the bar up with as much force as possible. The elbows should be tucked in until lockout.\n Return the bar to the pins, pausing before beginning the next repetition.\n

Front Barbell Squat To A Bench                        | Compound  | Quadriceps  | Barbell       | Strength              | Beginner     | 5.3 | Barbell Squat To A Bench                      | Dumbbell Squat To A Bench                             | Barbell Full Squat                                  | -                                       | -                             | -                        | -                        | -                   | -                     | This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set a flat bench behind you and set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\n Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you touch the bench with your glutes. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The front squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. This version of the squat is better suited for advanced athletes.\n

Stand with your side to the cable with a wide stance, and grab the rope with both hands.\n Twist your body away from the pulley as you bring the rope over your shoulder like you’re performing a judo flip.\n Shift your weight between your feet as you twist and crunch forward, pulling the cable downward.\n Return to the starting position and repeat until failure.\n Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.\n\nTip: Although this should be one continuous movement, think of it as two separate ab movements: the twist for obliques and the crunch for abs. This will help with the mind-muscle connection. Also, over exaggerate the end of the crunch by pausing for a moment and clinching your abs in an isometric hold before releasing.

Keep your torso erect, and hold this position for 10-20 seconds.\n Now, place the arm on the same side as your front leg on the ground, with the elbow next to the foot. Your other hand should be placed on the ground, parallel to your lead leg, to help support you during this portion of the stretch.\n After 10-20 seconds, place your hands on either side of your front foot. Raise the toes of the front foot off of the ground, and straighten your leg. You may need to reposition your rear leg to do so. Hold for 10-20 seconds, and then repeat the entire sequence for the other side.\n

Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, your knees and hips slightly bent, with good posture throughout your spine. This will be your starting position.\n To initiate the movement, lift one foot slightly off the floor to transfer the load to the working leg. Begin flexing the hips and knees into a quarter squat, generating an elastic force that will be used to power your jump. Swing your arms behind you in preparation for the movement.\n Explode out of the hole, extending your hip, knee, and ankle of your working leg to propel you upward and slightly forward, striving for maximum height. Swing your arms forward as you jump for added momentum.\n As you land on the platform, absorb the impact by allowing the hips and knees to flex into a partial squat. Use both legs to step down and return to the starting position. It is not advised to jump down from the box during this exercise.\n

Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.\n Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\n Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\n As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so.\n Receive the bar with the feet split, aggressively moving one foot forward and one foot back. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom position, which will help in the recovery.\n Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Bring the feet together as you stand up.\n
