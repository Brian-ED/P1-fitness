# TODOs, Arbitrary order:
- [*] Store text in the double array between each infinity. Just hope user doesn't type out the infinity representation.

- [ ] Add click-to-switch tab.

- [ ] Add allignment. Probably just snap to grid. Or cross checking other positions?

- [ ] Add Button sticking. When you start dragging a button, don't drag another with you. Plus don't drag 2 at the same time.

- [ ] Resize the interaction area to be within the icon rectnagles.

- [ ] Maybe have 3 different icon dragers, up-down, left-right, all 4.
