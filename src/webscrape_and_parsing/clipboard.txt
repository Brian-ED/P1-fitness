    Quadriceps
    Single-Leg Press

Single-Leg Press

The single-leg leg press is an exercise targeting the quadriceps one leg at a time. Many lifters prefer the leg press to squatting for several reasons, including the perception that it�s safer for the spine.
Benefits

    Builds stronger, more muscular quads
    Using one leg at time allows for heightened focus
    Also recruits helps from the hamstrings and glutes

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps
    Equipment: Machine

    Load the sled to an appropriate weight. Seat yourself on the machine, planting one foot on the platform in line with your hip. Your free foot can be placed on the ground. Maintain good spinal position with your head and chest up.
    Supporting the weight, fully extend the knee and unlock the sled. This will be your starting position.
    Lower the weight by flexing the hip and knee, continuing as far as flexibility allows. Do not allow your lumbar to take the load by moving your pelvis.
    At the bottom of the motion pause briefly and then return to the starting position by extending the hip and knee.
    Complete all repetitions for one leg before switching to the other.

    Abdominals
    Landmine twist

Landmine twist

The landmine twist is a rotational abdominal movement performed using an angled barbell anchored at floor level in a landmine device. It can also be performed by sticking a barbell in the corner of a room, preferably in a towel to protect the walls. It targets the deep muscles of the core, including both the obliques and the transversus abdominis. It can be done fast or slow, for time or reps, either in traditional muscle-focused rep ranges such as 8-12 reps per side or for higher rep ranges.
Benefits

    Maximizes force transfer through the legs, core, and arms
    Powerful rotational core training
    Trains coordination and power simultaneously

    Raise the bar from the floor, taking it to shoulder height with both hands with your arms extended in front of you. Adopt a wide stance. This will be your starting position.
    Perform the movement by rotating the trunk and hips as you swing the weight all the way down to one side. Keep your arms extended throughout the exercise.
    Reverse the motion to swing the weight all the way to the opposite side.
    Continue alternating the movement until the set is complete.

    Weighted pull-up

Weighted pull-up

The weighted pull-up is a more advanced variation of the pull-up exercise in which the lifter adds extra weight to their body. Options for adding weight include a dip belt, weighted vest, chains, a dumbbell placed between the feet or legs, or looping a kettlebell over the foot. Like other pull-up variations, the weighted pull-up builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core.
Benefits

    Strengthens the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), biceps, upper back, core, and grip
    Allows you to train pull-ups in lower strength-focused rep ranges (e.g., sets of 3-5 reps) if you can do many bodyweight reps
    Can help boost your overall pull-up numbers
    Heavy, low-rep sets activate different types of muscle fibers, potentially leading to muscle and strength gains

Weighted pull-up Instructions
Weighted pull-up muscle diagram

    Attach a weight to a dip belt and secure it around your waist. Grab the pull-up bar with the palms of your hands facing forward. For a medium grip, your hands should be spaced at shoulder width. Both arms should be extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip.
    You'll want to bring your torso back about 30 degrees while creating a curvature in your lower back and sticking your chest out. This will be your starting position.
    Now, exhale and pull your torso up until your head is above your hands. Concentrate on squeezing your shoulder blades back and down as you reach the top contracted position.
    After a brief moment at the top contracted position, inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position with your arms extended and your lats fully stretched.

Palms-down wrist curl over bench muscle diagram

    Start out by placing a barbell on one side of a flat bench.
    Kneel down on both of your knees so that your body is facing the flat bench.
    Use your arms to grab the barbell with a pronated grip (palms down) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the flat bench. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge.
    Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling.
    Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can also be performed sitting down by using your thighs as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over your knees and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed.
    You can also use a dumbbell instead of a barbell.

    Begin with the atlas stone between your feet. Bend at the hips to wrap your arms vertically around the Atlas Stone, attempting to get your fingers underneath the stone. Many stones will have a small flat portion on the bottom, which will make the stone easier to hold.
    Pulling the stone into your torso, drive through the back half of your feet to pull the stone from the ground.
    As the stone passes the knees, lap it by sitting backward, pulling the stone on top of your thighs.
    Sit low, getting the stone high onto your chest as you change your grip to reach over the stone. Stand, driving through with your hips. Close distance to the loading platform, and lean back, extending the hips to get the stone as high as possible.

    Dumbbell front raise to lateral raise

Dumbbell front raise to lateral raise

The dumbbell front raise to lateral raise is a dumbbell complex that combines two exercises that build and strengthen the middle deltoids and the anterior deltoids of the shoulders. It is usually performed one rep of each movement at a time, although you could perform more reps of each, or increase the reps in successive rounds (e.g., 1 rep in round 1, 2 reps in round 2, etc.). No matter how you perform it, it targets both the anterior and medial deltoids, making it a great time-efficient shoulder burnout or accessory movement on an upper-body day.
Benefits

    Builds size in shoulders
    Prolonged muscle time under tension
    Great burnout on shoulder day or time-efficient shoulder pump in any workout

    Lower the weights with a controlled motion.
    On the next repetition, raise the weights in front of you to shoulder height before moving the weights laterally to your sides.
    Lower the weights to the starting position.

Clean from Blocks muscle diagram

    With a barbell on boxes or stands of the desired height, take an overhand or hook grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.
    Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight with the elbows pointed out. Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight. At the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.3. As full extension is achieved, transition into the receiving position by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. Aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.
    Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position. Return the weight to the boxes for the next rep.

Straight-bar wrist roll-up

The straight-bar wrist roll-up is a movement targeting the muscles of the forearms and hands. It is normally performed in high reps, for time, or simply to failure as a burnout for the lower arms. If shoulder fatigue limits your ability to perform the movement, it can be done with the barbell resting in a rack.
Benefits

    Builds hand and wrist strength
    Builds forearm size and strength
    Doesn't require unique equipment
    If grip strength is a limitation, lifting straps allow heavier loading

    Barbell glute bridge

Barbell glute bridge

The barbell glute bridge is a popular exercise targeting the muscles of the glutes and hamstrings. It can be done as a strength movement on its own, as an activation drill or warm-up for lower-body training, or as a burnout at the end of a lower-body workout.
Benefits

    Strengthens the glutes, hamstrings, and quads
    Allows you to track and periodize weights more easily than when using a band
    Builds strength that carries over into squats, deadlifts, and other movements
    Great warm-up or glute activation drill to do anytime

    Type: Powerlifting

    Begin seated on the ground with a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused by this exercise. Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lay down flat on the floor.
    Begin the movement by driving through with your heels, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your upper back and the heels of your feet.
    Extend as far as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position.

    Clean and press

Clean and press

The clean and press is a full-body lift comprised of two movements: the clean, where the bar is pulled from the floor and caught in the front rack position in three pulls or phases, followed by the overhead press. Decades ago, it was contested in the Olympics. Today, it remains a worthy centerpiece of a power and strength training program, and has full-body benefits when done for low reps as well as moderate to high reps.
Benefits

    Trains speed and power for athletic performance
    Cleaning between each rep of multiple presses is a strength and conditioning challenge like no other
    Great move for full-body strength and power

Clean and press Instructions
Clean and press muscle diagram

    Assume a shoulder-width stance, with knees inside the arms. Now while keeping the back flat, bend at the knees and hips so that you can grab the bar with the arms fully extended and a pronated grip that is slightly wider than shoulder width. Point the elbows out to sides. The bar should be close to the shins. Position the shoulders over or slightly ahead of the bar. Establish a flat back posture. This will be your starting position.
    Begin to pull the bar by extending the knees. Move your hips forward and raise the shoulders at the same rate while keeping the angle of the back constant; continue to lift the bar straight up while keeping it close to your body.
    As the bar passes the knee, extend at the ankles, knees, and hips forcefully, similar to a jumping motion. As you do so, continue to guide the bar with your hands, shrugging your shoulders and using the momentum from your movement to pull the bar as high as possible. The bar should travel close to your body, and you should keep your elbows out.
    At maximum elevation, your feet should clear the floor and you should start to pull yourself under the bar. The mechanics of this could change slightly, depending on the weight used. You should descend into a squatting position as you pull yourself under the bar.
    As the bar hits terminal height, rotate your elbows around and under the bar. Rack the bar across the front of the shoulders while keeping the torso erect and flexing the hips and knees to absorb the weight of the bar.
    Stand to full height, holding the bar in the clean position.
    Without moving your feet, press the bar overhead as you exhale. Lower the bar under control .

    Triceps dip

Triceps dip

The triceps dip is a bodyweight exercise performed on parallel bars or on a pull-up and dip station. It targets the triceps first, but also stretches and strengthens the chest and shoulders. Dips with a triceps focus are usually performed with an upright torso, the knees bent and crossed, and the arms close to the body. Dips can be performed for low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle growth.
Benefits

    Builds muscle and strength in the triceps, as well as the chest and shoulders
    Can add extra weight with a dip belt, dumbbell, or chain
    Serious upper-body training with minimal equipment

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Triceps

Triceps dip Instructions
Triceps dip muscle diagram

    To get into the starting position, hold your body at arm's length with your arms nearly locked above the bars.
    Now, inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm.
    Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations: If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a dip assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.

Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.

More advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.

    Dumbbell farmer's walk

Dumbbell farmer's walk

The dumbbell farmer's walk is an exercise with roots in competitive strongman training, but which is also popular in CrossFit and functional training. It can be a challenging finisher to any workout, or work well in fat-loss circuit training or as an accessory movement to heavy lifts like the deadlift.
Benefits

    Strengthens and challenges the grip, core, traps, upper back, shoulders, and legs
    Serious cardiovascular challenge and calorie burn
    Less complex to learn and perform properly than many other popular strength movements
    Builds muscular coordination and mental toughness in addition to strength and muscle
    If grip strength is a limiting factor, lifting straps can still enable you to use heavy weights

    Start out by placing a barbell on one side of a flat bench.
    Kneel down on both of your knees so that your body is facing the flat bench.
    Use your arms to grab the barbell with a supinated grip (palms up) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the flat bench. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge.
    Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling.
    Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can also be performed sitting down by using your thighs as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over your knees and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed.
    You can also use a dumbbell instead of a barbell.

Barbell Full Squat

The barbell back squat is a popular compound movement that emphasizes building the lower-body muscle groups and overall strength. It's the classic way to start a leg day, and is a worthy centerpiece to a lower-body training program. The squat is a competitive lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also a classic measurement of lower-body strength. With the barbell racked on the traps or upper back, the emphasis is placed on the posterior chain but the entire body gets worked. The back squat can be trained in everything from heavy singles to sets of 20 reps or higher.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    Requires back and core strength to maintain torso positioning
    Can be used to improve conditioning and cardiovascular health
    Considered by many to be "the king of exercises"

Barbell Full Squat Instructions
Barbell Full Squat muscle diagram

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack just above shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.
    Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.
    Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting back with your hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your hamstrings are on your calves. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel or middle of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

This type of squat allows a greater range of motion, and allows the trunk to maintain a more vertical position than other types of squats, due to foot position and the higher bar position.

    Barbell deficit deadlift

Barbell deficit deadlift

The barbell deficit deadlift is a compound exercise targeting the posterior chain. It is commonly utilized in powerlifting training to build pulling strength off the floor, but is also an effective muscle-building movement for the glutes and hamstrings. It is usually performed with lighter weight, and perhaps for higher reps, than traditional deadlifts. If these make your back sore, decrease the deficit and/or wear a weightlifting belt.
Benefits

    The deficit offers a greater range of motion for targeting the hamstrings
    Builds size and strength in the glutes, hamstrings, and lower and upper back
    Builds overall deadlift strength

    Type: Powerlifting
    Main Muscle Worked: Lower Back

    Begin by having a platform or weight plates that you can stand on, usually 1-3 inches in height. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets.
    With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.
    Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.

    Barbell Deadlift

Barbell Deadlift

The barbell deadlift is a compound exercise used to develop overall strength and size in the posterior chain. It is a competition lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also considered a classic benchmark of overall strength. When performed with the hands outside the knees, it is often called a "conventional" deadlift. When the feet are wide and the hands are inside the knees, it is a sumo deadlift.
Benefits

    Primarily targets the back, hamstrings, and glutes, but also brings in the lats, traps, and forearms
    Builds core strength and stability
    Can be beneficial even at light or moderate weights
    Simple to scale for non-powerlifters by raising the bar to where someone can perform it without flexing their lower back
    If grip is a limitation, it can be performed with a mixed grip or using straps

    With your feet and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and flex the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head. Keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward.
    After the bar passes the knees aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.
    Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.

    Single-arm palm-in dumbbell shoulder press

Single-arm palm-in dumbbell shoulder press

The single-arm palm-in dumbbell shoulder press builds the shoulder muscles but with two major differences from the standard dumbbell shoulder press. It's done one arm at a time and the wrist stays neutral throughout the movement. It can be performed standing or seated. A single dumbbell press can be pursued as a strength goal, or trained in traditional muscle-building rep ranges such as 8-15 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Allows for greater focus on one shoulder at a time
    Forces the core to stabilize an uneven load
    A neutral grip may be easier on the shoulder joint than a palms-forward grip

    Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. Now slowly lift the dumbbell up until you create a 90 degree angle with your arm. Note: Your forearm should be perpendicular to the floor. Continue to maintain a neutral grip throughout the entire exercise.
    Slowly lift the dumbbell up until your arm is fully extended. This the starting position.
    While inhaling lower the weight down until your arm is at a 90 degree angle again.
    Feel the contraction for a second and then lift the weight back up towards the starting position while exhaling. Remember to hold on to the incline bench and keep your feet positioned to keep balance during the exercise.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the exercise.

Variation: This exercise can be performed with dumbbells in each arm as the dumbbells will help to keep you balanced. This is another great way to add variety to your routines and keep them interesting.

    Romanian Deadlift With Dumbbells

Romanian Deadlift With Dumbbells

The dumbbell stiff-legged deadlift targets the hamstrings, glutes, low and upper back, as well as the core. The purpose of the stiff-legged, as opposed to Romanian deadlift with slightly bent knees, is to engage the hamstrings and low back to an even greater degree.
Benefits

    Strengthening the glutes and hamstrings will carry over to other forms of the deadlift such as conventional
    Higher reps with lower weight will lend to hypertrophy of the hamstrings and posterior chain
    Also works the calves, quads, and forearms indirectly

    Type: Strength

Romanian Deadlift With Dumbbells Instructions
Romanian Deadlift With Dumbbells muscle diagram

    Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand. Ensure that your back is straight and stays that way for the duration of the exercise. Allow your arms to hang perpendicular to the floor, with the wrists pronated and the elbows pointed to your sides. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by flexing your hips, slowly pushing your butt as far back as you can. This should entail a horizontal movement of the hips, rather than a downward movement. The knees should only partially bend, and your weight should remain on your heels.
    Drive your butt back as far as you can, which should generate tension in your hamstrings as your hands approach knee level. Maintain an arch in your back throughout the exercise.
    When your hips cannot perform any further backward movement, pause, and then slowly return to the starting position by extending the hips.

Clean Deadlift muscle diagram

    Begin standing with a barbell close to your shins. Your feet should be directly under your hips with your feet turned out slightly. Grip the bar with a double overhand grip or hook grip, about shoulder width apart. Squat down to the bar. Your spine should be in full extension, with a back angle that places your shoulders in front of the bar and your back as vertical as possible.
    Begin by driving through the floor through the front of your heels. As the bar travels upward, maintain a constant back angle. Flare your knees out to the side to help keep them out of the bar's path.
    After the bar crosses the knees, complete the lift by driving the hips into the bar until your hips and knees are extended.

    Barbell back squat to box

Barbell back squat to box

The barbell back squat to box is a popular version of a classic lower-body exercise that utilizes a box at the bottom position of the movement. This allows the lifter to customize the depth of the squat, as well as limit the stretch reflex at the bottom of the squat. The movement targets the quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings. The squat to box can be performed for low reps to build strength or power, or for higher reps to build muscle.
Benefits

    Allows for a customizable squat depth
    Encourages squatting rearward rather than downward, targeting the glutes
    Works well with accommodating resistance like bands and chains
    Effective substitute for back squats in any program

    Type: Powerlifting

Barbell back squat to box Instructions
Barbell back squat to box muscle diagram

    The box squat allows you to squat to desired depth and develop explosive strength in the squat movement. Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired.
    Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.
    With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.
    Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe.

Clean and jerk

The clean and jerk is a full-body lift that is one of two contested lifts in Olympic weightlifting competitions. It is comprised of two movements: the clean, where the bar is pulled from the floor and caught in the front rack position in three pulls or phases, followed by the jerk overhead. The clean and jerk hits every muscle from head to toe and can be the centerpiece of a lifting program. It is also popular in CrossFit and athletic training programs. It is usually performed in low rep ranges, focusing on power and movement quality.
Benefits

    Trains speed and power for athletic performance
    Allows you to use more weight than a strict press or push-press
    Great move for full-body strength and power

Clean and jerk muscle diagram

    With a barbell on the floor close to the shins, take an overhand or hook grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.
    Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.
    Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.
    As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.
    Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.
    The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.
    Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.
    At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be split, with one foot forward, and one foot back. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead. Return to a standing position.

    Single-arm kettlebell push-press

Single-arm kettlebell push-press

The single-arm kettlebell push-press is a popular kettlebell movement that involves performing a press with help from the muscles of the lower body. It is preceded by a clean at the start of each set, and optionally you can perform a clean between each rep. It can be trained in traditional strength or muscle-building rep ranges, in circuit or fat-loss training, or as part of a larger kettlebell combination or complex.
Benefits

    Momentum from the legs powers the weight through the toughest part of the press
    Allows you to press more weight than a strict military press
    Full-body training that challenges the lower body as well as the shoulders, arms, back, and core
    Cleaning the kettlebells to the rack position trains the hips, core, and back muscles

    Hold a kettlebell by the handle. Clean the kettlebell to your shoulder by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the kettlebell towards your shoulder. Rotate your wrist as you do so, so that the palm faces forward. This will be your starting position.
    Dip your body by bending the knees, keeping your torso upright.
    Immediately reverse direction, driving through the heels, in essence jumping to create momentum. As you do so, press the kettlebell overhead to lockout by extending the arms, using your body's momentum to move the weight. Lower the weight to perform the next repetition.

    Quadriceps
    Push-press

Push-press

The push-press is an overhead press variation in which the barbell is pushed upward with assistance from the lower body.

Benefits

    Builds full-body power, strength, and coordination
    Allows you to put heavier weight overhead than with a strict press
    Works for low reps and moderate to high reps
    Great full-body move with a shoulder emphasis

    Suspended ab fall-out

Suspended ab fall-out

The suspended ab fall-out is a dynamic abdominal exercise utilizing a suspension strap system or gymnastic rings. It is similar in form to an ab roller, but can more easily be scaled to be more or less difficult. It targets the muscles of the rectus abdominis or "six-pack" muscles, as well as the deep core muscles. It can be trained for low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle definition.
Benefits

    Intense training of multiple core muscles
    Difficulty level can easily be changed by raising or lowering the straps
    Also works muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi) and shoulders

    Adjust the straps so the handles are at an appropriate height, below waist level.
    Begin standing and grasping the handles. Lean into the straps, moving to an incline push-up position. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your arms straight, lean further into the suspension straps, bringing your body closer to the ground, allowing your shoulders to extend, raising your arms up and over your head.
    Maintain a neutral spine and keep the rest of your body straight, your shoulders being the only joints allowed to move.
    Pause during the peak contraction, and then return to the starting position.

    Military press

Military press

The military press is a compound movement used to build size and strength in the shoulders. It was once contested as a fourth powerlift, but is rarely competed anymore. However, being able to press a significant weight overhead remains a popular marker of upper-body strength. The military press can be trained as a strength lift or in traditional muscle-building rep ranges as part of full-body, shoulder-focused, or upper-body training.
Benefits

    Serious shoulder builder and overall strength measurement
    Builds upper-body strength for other movements
    Encourages healthy shoulder mobility
    Triceps, core, upper back, and legs help move and stabilize the barbell

    Type: Strength

Military press Instructions
Military press muscle diagram

    Start by placing a barbell that is about chest high on a squat rack. Once you have selected the weights, grab the barbell using a pronated (palms facing forward) grip. Make sure to grip the bar wider than shoulder width apart from each other.
    Slightly bend the knees and place the barbell on your collar bone. Lift the barbell up keeping it lying on your chest. Take a step back and position your feet shoulder width apart from each other.
    Once you pick up the barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. This is your starting position.
    Lower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale.
    Lift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can also be performed sitting as those with lower back problems are better off performing this seated variety.
    The behind the neck variation is not recommended for people with shoulder problems as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.
    Another option is to use dumbbells when performing this exercise for better isolation.

    Power snatch-

Power snatch-

The power snatch is a full-body lift in which the bar is pulled from the floor with a wide grip to the overhead position in one movement. The bar is received in the "power" position, with the hips higher than a full-depth squat position. The power snatch can be used as a learning tool for the full snatch, or to train muscular power and strength on its own. It is usually performed for low reps, focusing on power and movement quality.
Benefits

    Trains speed, strength, and power for athletic performance
    Demands and develops overhead strength and stability in the shoulders and upper back
    Great progression for the full snatch
    Excellent strength and power work even with light weights

    Type: Olympic Weightlifting

Power snatch- Instructions
Power snatch- muscle diagram

    Place your feet at a shoulder width stance with the barbell resting right above the connection between the toes and the rest of the foot.
    With a palms facing down grip, bend at the knees and keeping the back flat grab the bar using a wider than shoulder width grip. Bring the hips down and make sure that your body drops as if you were going to sit on a chair. This will be your starting position.
    Start pushing the floor as if it were a moving platform with your feet and simultaneously start lifting the barbell keeping it close to your legs.
    As the bar reaches the middle of your thighs, push the floor with your legs and lift your body to a complete extension in an explosive motion.
    Lift your shoulders back in a shrugging movement as you bring the bar up while lifting your elbows out to the side and keeping them above the bar for as long as possible.
    Now in a very quick but powerful motion, you have to get your body under the barbell when it has reached a high enough point where it can be controlled and drop while locking your arms and holding the barbell overhead as you assume a squat position.
    Finalize the movement by rising up out of the squat position to finish the lift. At the end of the lift both feet should be on line and the arms fully extended holding the barbell overhead.

Caution: This is a very advanced exercise so be extremely careful with the weight used. Bad form on this exercise can lead to serious injury.

    Sumo deadlift

Sumo deadlift

The sumo deadlift is a compound movement in which the feet are set in a wide stance with toes pointed out and grip is placed inside of the legs. It is allowed to be performed instead of conventional deadlifts in most powerlifting competitions. The sumo deadlift targets the hamstrings, glutes, and upper back/traps, but also has a greater emphasis on stretching and strengthening the adductor and hip muscles due to the wide stance.
Benefits

    Builds overall strength, power, and size
    Many find it easier on the lower back than the conventional deadlift
    Strengthens the hips and requires a greater degree of mobility
    Same full-body strength benefits as conventional deadlift

Sumo deadlift Instructions
Sumo deadlift muscle diagram

    Begin with a bar loaded on the ground. Approach the bar so that the bar intersects the middle of the feet. The feet should be set very wide, near the collars. Bend at the hips to grip the bar. The arms should be directly below the shoulders, inside the legs, and you can use a pronated grip, a mixed grip, or hook grip. Relax the shoulders, which in effect lengthens your arms.
    Take a breath, and then lower your hips, looking forward with your head with your chest up. Drive through the floor, spreading your feet apart, with your weight on the back half of your feet. Extend through the hips and knees.
    As the bar passes through the knees, lean back and drive the hips into the bar, pulling your shoulder blades together.
    Return the weight to the ground by bending at the hips and controlling the weight on the way down.

Hang Clean Instructions
Hang Clean muscle diagram

    Begin with a shoulder width, double overhand or hook grip, with the bar hanging at the mid thigh position. Your back should be straight and inclined slightly forward.
    Begin by aggressively extending through the hips, knees and ankles, driving the weight upward. As you do so, shrug your shoulders towards your ears. As full extension is achieved, transition into the final pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.3. Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.

Dumbbell V-Sit Cross Jab

The dumbbell V-sit cross jab is a hybrid movement that trains the abdominal and shoulder muscles simultaneously. It can address multiple muscle groups in a time-efficient muscle-building or circuit-style workout, while also providing a cardiovascular challenge.
Benefits

    Strengthens the core to stabilize while the upper body is moving
    Great shoulder pump, even with light weights
    Excellent cardiovascular and conditioning challenge

Dumbbell V-Sit Cross Jab muscle diagram

    Begin seated on your butt with your knees bent and feet on the ground. Lean your upper body back to form a 45-degree angle with the floor. Bring your feet off the ground so that your body resembles a "V" shape.
    Grasp a dumbbell in each hand and hold tight to your chest with palms facing each other. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping your core tight and maintaining your body's "V" position, quickly extend your left arm straight out (similar to a jab) and then bring it back to the starting position while simultaneously punching out with the right arm.
    Your torso and legs may slightly rotate side to side opposite of your hands throughout the movement—this is okay.
    A punch with each hand counts as one total repetition. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.

Reverse Band Box Squat muscle diagram

    Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Set up the bands either on band pegs or attached to the top of the rack, ensuring they will be directly above the bar during the squat. Attach the other end to the bar.
    Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.
    With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.
    Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe. Use care to return the barbell to the rack.

    Start by having a dumbbell in each hand with your arm fully extended to the side using a neutral grip. Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. Now slowly lift the dumbbells up until you create a 90 degree angle with your arms. Note: Your forearms should be perpendicular to the floor. This the starting position.
    Continue to maintain a neutral grip throughout the entire exercise. Slowly lift the dumbbells up until your arms are fully extended.
    While inhaling lower the weights down until your arm is at a 90 degree angle again.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: This exercise can be performed with a dumbbell in one arm and another holding on to an incline bench. This is another great way to add variety to your routines and keep them interesting.

    Standing cable low-to-high twist

Standing cable low-to-high twist

The standing cable low-to-high twist is a core exercise targeting the upper abdominals and the obliques. Take care to perform it with control, as opposed to violent twisting which can injure the back. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-15 per side, as part of the core-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Builds core strength and muscle control
    Also works the shoulders, arms, back, and lower body
    The cables provide constant tension on the muscles

Standing cable low-to-high twist muscle diagram

    Connect a standard handle on a tower, and move the cable to the lowest pulley position.
    With your side to the cable, grab the handle with one hand and step away from the tower. You should be approximately arm’s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable. Your outstretched arm should be aligned with the cable.
    With your feet positioned shoulder width apart, squat down and grab the handle with both hands. Your arms should still be fully extended.
    In one motion, pull the handle up and across your body until your arms are in a fully-extended position above your head.
    Keep your back straight and your arms close to your body as you pivot your back foot and straighten your legs to get a full range of motion.
    Retract your arms and then your body. Return to the neutral position in a slow and controlled manner.
    Repeat to failure.
    Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.

Tip: You will twist your entire body with this exercise, but focus on getting maximal torso rotation and a strong clinch at the end of the movement. To ensure a good mind-muscle connection, keep your abs tense at all times.

    Decline EZ-bar skullcrusher

Decline EZ-bar skullcrusher

The decline EZ-bar skullcrusher is a popular exercise targeting the triceps muscles. The angle of the bench creates a greater range of motion than flat bench skullcrushers, as well as targeting the lateral head of the muscle. This exercise is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.
Benefits

    Builds bigger and stronger triceps
    The EZ-bar is easier on the wrists than a straight bar
    Great stretch and activation on all three triceps heads, particularly the lateral head

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Triceps
    Equipment: E-Z Curl Bar

Decline EZ-bar skullcrusher muscle diagram

    Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench.
    Using a close grip (a grip that is slightly less than shoulder width), lift the EZ bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked and elbows in. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack.
    As you breathe in and you keep the upper arms stationary, bring the bar down slowly by moving your forearms in a semicircular motion towards you until you feel the bar slightly touch your forehead. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Lift the bar back to the starting position by contracting the triceps and exhaling.
    Repeat until the recommended amount of repetitions is performed.

Variations: You can use a straight bar or dumbbells to perform this movement. You can also perform it on a flat bench as well.

Standing behind-the-back wrist curl

The standing behind-the-back wrist curl is a popular exercise to target the muscles in the forearms, wrists, and fingers. It is generally performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-15 reps per set, and can work as isolated forearm training or as part of an arms-focused workout.
Benefits

    Isolates the forearms, forcing them to work alone
    Great sport-specific exercise for climbers and arm wrestlers
    Develops greater forearm size and finger strength

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Forearms

Standing behind-the-back wrist curl Instructions
Standing behind-the-back wrist curl muscle diagram

    Start by standing straight and holding a barbell behind your glutes at arm's length while using a pronated grip (palms will be facing back away from the glutes) and having your hands shoulder width apart from each other.
    You should be looking straight forward while your feet are shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position.
    While exhaling, slowly elevate the barbell up by curling your wrist in a semi-circular motion towards the ceiling. Note: Your wrist should be the only body part moving for this exercise.
    Hold the contraction for a second and lower the barbell back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    When finished, lower the barbell down to the squat rack or the floor by bending the knees. Tip: It is easiest to either pick it up from a squat rack or have a partner hand it to you.

Variations: You can also perform this exercise with dumbbells using the same movements as described above. Another option is to use one dumbbell at a time for better isolation.

Seated finger curl

The seated finger curl is an exercise targeting the muscles of the hands and forearms. It is popular with rock climbers and other athletes looking to build forearm size and strength. The range of motion is tiny, but done for moderate to high reps, these will definitely make the forearms burn.
Benefits

    Great for building forearm size and strength
    Also works the wrists directly
    Great for burnout sets at the end of an arm workout��������

    Hold a barbell with both hands and your palms facing up; hands spaced about shoulder width.
    Place your feet flat on the floor, at a distance that is slightly wider than shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position.
    Lower the bar as far as possible by extending the fingers. Allowing the bar to roll down the hands, catch the bar with the final joint in the fingers.
    Now curl bar up as high as possible by closing your hands while exhaling. Hold the contraction at the top.

    Wide-grip barbell curl

Wide-grip barbell curl

The wide-grip barbell curl is a variation of the classic barbell curl with the grip wider than shoulder width. It is thought that this helps build the inner or "short" head of the biceps muscles. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set.
Benefits

    Builds bigger and stronger biceps
    Allows you to use more weight than a narrow grip does
    Places the primary stress on the short (inner) head of the biceps

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Biceps
    Equipment: Barbell
    Level: Beginner

Wide-grip barbell curl Instructions
Wide-grip barbell curl muscle diagram

    Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at the wide outer handle. The palm of your hands should be facing forward. The elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Tip: Only the forearms should move.
    Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard.
    Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    You can also perform this movement using an E-Z bar or E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement.
    You may also use the closer grip for variety purposes.

    Dumbbell spell caster

Dumbbell spell caster

The dumbbell spell caster is an exercise that primarily targets the abdominal muscles such as the obliques. However, it also works shoulders, back, hips, and legs, and demands all of those muscles work together in a coordinated motion. It is usually performed with relatively light weights for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per side. Make sure to only use a weight you can control.
Benefits

    Strengthens the core, including the obliques
    Challenges and activates the upper back muscles
    Full-body strength and coordination challenge, even with light weights

    Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a pronated grip. Your feet should be wide with your hips and knees extended. This will be your starting position.
    Begin the movement by pulling both of the dumbbells to one side next to your hip, rotating your torso.
    Keeping your arms straight and the dumbbells parallel to the ground, rotate your torso to swing the weights to your opposite side.
    Continue alternating, rotating from one side to the other until the set is complete.

    Triceps
    Dumbbell floor press

Dumbbell floor press

The dumbbell floor press is a multijoint pressing exercise performed lying on the floor. It can be performed either with the knees bent or flat. The floor press limits the range of motion you would achieve with a regular dumbbell bench press, but still targets the chest, triceps, and anterior delts. This allows you to press more weight than in a dumbbell bench press, and perhaps put less stress on the shoulders.
Benefits

    Pressing from the floor with a neutral grip can take the stress off the shoulder joint
    Can overload and focus on building triceps strength and bench press lockout strength
    Takes your legs out of the movement, giving all the responsibility to your core and upper body
    Builds chest and triceps size and strength

    Type: Powerlifting
    Main Muscle Worked: Triceps
    Equipment: Dumbbell

    Lay on the floor holding dumbbells in your hands. Your knees can be bent. Begin with the weights fully extended above you.
    Lower the weights until your upper arm comes in contact with the floor. You can tuck your elbows to emphasize triceps size and strength, or to focus on your chest angle your arms to the side.
    Pause at the bottom, and then bring the weight together at the top by extending through the elbows.

    Lie face down with your whole body straight on a flat bench while holding a weight plate behind your head. Tip: You will need to position yourself so that your shoulders are slightly above the end of a flat bench in order for the upper chest, neck and face to be off the bench. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping the plate secure on the back of your head slowly lower your head (as in saying yes) as you breathe in.
    Raise your head back up to the starting position in a semi-circular motion as you breathe out. Hold the contraction for a second.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: As with all exercises, refrain from using any sort of sudden or jerking motions.

Variation: You can opt to use no resistance at first.

    Lats
    Pullups

Pullups

The pull-up is a multi-joint bodyweight exercise that builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core. It is often used as a measurement tool in military or tactical fitness tests, and is an excellent gauge of �relative strength� which is strength in relation to bodyweight.
Benefits

    Strengthens the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), biceps, upper back, core, and grip
    Requires no equipment other than a bar
    Can build absolute strength for low reps, or strength endurance for higher reps
    Easy to alter grip style and width to target different muscles or rep ranges

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Lats
    Equipment: Body Only

Pullups Instructions
Pullups muscle diagram

    Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.
    As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
    Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
    After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.
    Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.
    Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.
    On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.
    The behind the neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.

    Lie on your back on a decline bench and hold on to the top of the bench with both hands. Don't let your body slip down from this position.
    Hold your legs parallel to the floor using your abs to hold them there while keeping your knees and feet together. Tip: Your legs should be fully extended with a slight bend on the knee. This will be your starting position.
    While exhaling, move your legs towards the torso as you roll your pelvis backwards and you raise your hips off the bench. At the end of this movement your knees will be touching your chest.
    Hold the contraction for a second and move your legs back to the starting position while inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can do the movement on a flat surface and as you get more advanced you can use ankle weights.

    Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.
    Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position.
    Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.

Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.

Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor.

Variations:

Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other.

Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.

Jumping rope Instructions
Jumping rope muscle diagram

    Hold an end of the rope in each hand. Position the rope behind you on the ground. Raise your arms up and turn the rope over your head bringing it down in front of you. When it reaches the ground, jump over it. Find a good turning pace that can be maintained. Different speeds and techniques can be used to introduce variation.
    Rope jumping is exciting, challenges your coordination, and requires a lot of energy. A 150 lb person will burn about 350 calories jumping rope for 30 minutes, compared to over 450 calories running.

    Seated barbell shoulder press

Seated barbell shoulder press

The seated barbell shoulder press is a classic exercise for building muscle and strength in the shoulders. The triceps also play a significant role in pressing the barbell overhead. Performing the movement seated reduces help from the lower body and decreases the risk of overextending the lumbar spine during the movement. This press variation can be the primary pressing movement on an upper-body or shoulder day, or an effective accessory movement later in a workout.
Benefits

    Builds shoulder muscle and strength
    Seated position enforces strict form
    Less risk of tweaking the lower back than with a standing press

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Shoulders
    Equipment: Barbell

Seated barbell shoulder press Instructions
Seated barbell shoulder press muscle diagram

    Sit on a Military Press Bench with a bar behind your head and either have a spotter give you the bar (better on the rotator cuff this way) or pick it up yourself carefully with a pronated grip (palms facing forward). Tip: Your grip should be wider than shoulder width and it should create a 90-degree angle between the forearm and the upper arm as the barbell goes down.
    Once you pick up the barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. This is your starting position.
    Lower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale.
    Lift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can also be performed standing but those with lower back problems are better off performing this seated variety.
    The behind the neck variation is not recommended for people with shoulder problems as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.

EZ-bar spider curl

The EZ-bar spider curl is an exercise targeting the biceps and performed face down on either an incline bench or on the flat side of a preacher bench. The EZ-bar makes for a more comfortable wrist position, while the angle helps to isolate the biceps and limit involvement of the shoulder muscles. This curl variation is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or arm-focused training.
Benefits

    Adds size and definition to the biceps
    Positioning on the incline bench helps isolate the biceps and enforce strict form
    Great burnout movement on arm day

    Make sure that your feet (especially the toes) are well positioned on the floor and place your upper arms on top of the pad located on the inside part of the preacher bench.
    Use your arms to grab the barbell with a supinated grip (palms facing up) at about shoulder width apart or slightly closer from each other.
    Slowly begin to lift the barbell upwards and exhale. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
    Slowly begin to bring the barbell back to the starting position as your breathe in. .
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: You can also use dumbbells when performing this exercise. Just make sure you place the dumbbells on the part of the preacher bench where you would normally sit properly.

The Smith machine shrug is an upper-body exercise targeting the traps (trapezius muscles). It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of shoulder or trap-focused training.
Benefits

    Adds size and height to the traps

Smith machine shrug muscle diagram

    To begin, set the bar height on the smith machine around the middle of your thighs. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, grab the bar using a pronated grip (palms facing you) shoulder width apart from each other.
    Lift the barbell up and fully extend your arms with your back straight. This is the starting position.
    While exhaling, elevate the bar by raising your shoulders until they come close to touching your ears.
    Hold the contraction for a second before lowering the bar back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can be performed using a squat rack with a barbell. However, be careful not to select a weight that is so heavy that it causes you to break good form as you do not have the support of the smith machine for this variation. Too much weight can harm your back.
    You can also use dumbbells to perform this exercise.

    Return slowly to the starting position as you breathe in while lowering your heels.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Begin standing while holding a bar at arm’s length in front of you. You can stand on a raised platform to increase the range of motion.
    Begin by flexing the knees slightly, and then flex at the hip, moving your butt back as far as possible, lowering the torso as far as flexibility allows. The back should remain in absolute extension at all times, and the bar should remain in contact with the legs. If done properly, there should be heavy tension felt in the hamstrings.
    Reverse the motion to return to the starting position.

Power Snatch muscle diagram

    Begin with a loaded barbell on the floor. The bar should be close to or touching the shins, and a wide grip should be taken on the bar. The feet should be directly below the hips, with the feet turned out as needed. Lower the hips, with the chest up and the head looking forward. The shoulders should be just in front of the bar. This will be the starting position.
    Begin the first pull by driving through the front of the heels, raising the bar from the ground. The back angle should stay the same until the bar passes the knees.
    Transition into the second pull by extending through the hips knees and ankles, driving the bar up as quickly as possible. The bar should be close to the body. At peak extension, shrug the shoulders and allow the elbows to flex to the side.
    As you move your feet into the receiving position, a slightly wider position, pull yourself below the bar as you elevate the bar overhead. The bar should be received in a partial squat. Continue raising the bar to the overhead position, receiving the bar locked out overhead.
    Return to a standing position with the weight over head.

Pushups

The push-up is a popular bodyweight exercise that is commonly used in military and tactical physical fitness tests. It�s a classic movement to build upper-body muscle and strength, emphasizing the chest, triceps, and shoulders, but also working the upper back and core.
Benefits

    Strengthens the chest, triceps, shoulders, and abdominals
    Increases core strength and hip stability
    Engages lower-body muscles to maintain plank position
    Easy to regress or progress by raising or lowering torso
    Can add pauses or manipulate tempo to increase difficulty

Pushups Instructions
Pushups muscle diagram

    Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart while holding your torso up at arms length.
    Next, lower yourself downward until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale.
    Now breathe out and press your upper body back up to the starting position while squeezing your chest.
    After a brief pause at the top contracted position, you can begin to lower yourself downward again for as many repetitions as needed.

Variations:

If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, you can either bend your legs at the knees to take off resistance or perform the exercise against the wall instead of the floor.

For the most advanced lifters, you can place your feet at a high surface such as a bench in order to increase the resistance and to target the upper chest more.

    Spider crawl

Spider crawl

The spider crawl is a bodyweight exercise that involves crawling on the floor with the knees outside of the elbows. It is different from a leopard crawl in that the hips are higher, and it's different from a bear crawl because the knees are wider. It can be done as a full-body warm-up, in short bursts for power or circuit training, or for longer durations as cardiovascular conditioning.
Benefits

    Intense challenge even with no added weight
    Engrains cross-body gait pattern and athletic coordination
    Challenges the shoulders, core, legs, arms, and back

    Type: Strength

    Initiate the movement by raising one foot off of the ground. Externally rotate the leg and bring the knee toward your elbow, as far forward as possible.
    Return this leg to the starting position and repeat on the opposite side.

Power Clean from Blocks Instructions
Power Clean from Blocks muscle diagram

    With a barbell on boxes of the desired height, take a grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.
    Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips.
    In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight. At the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.
    As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, pull yourself under the bar far enough that it can be racked onto the shoulders, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed.
    Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position, and complete the repetition by returning the weight to the boxes.

    Reverse-grip bent-over row

Reverse-grip bent-over row

The reverse-grip bent-over row is a compound exercise used to build strength and size in both the lower and upper back. It targets nearly all of the muscles in the back, but particularly the lats, rhomboids, and lower back. It is thought to target the biceps and lats a bit more directly than overhand barbell rows. Because it can be loaded heavily, it is a popular movement in strength and muscle-focused upper-body workouts.
Benefits

    Reverse grip requires more work from the biceps and targets the lats
    Strengthens the lats, rhomboids, spinal erectors, hamstrings, and glutes
    Teaches proper ab bracing and maintains positioning of the spine

Reverse-grip bent-over row Instructions
Reverse-grip bent-over row muscle diagram

    Stand erect while holding a barbell with a supinated grip (palms facing up).
    Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.
    While keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.
    Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution:

    This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.
    Also, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.
    Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a pronated (palms facing out) grip or using dumbbells.

    Put a bench in front of a low pulley machine that has a barbell or EZ Curl attachment on it.
    Move the bench far enough away so that when you bring the handle to the top of your thighs tension is created on the cable due to the weight stack being moved up.
    Now hold the handle with both hands, palms up, using a shoulder-width grip.
    Step back and sit on the bench with your feet about shoulder width apart, firmly on the floor.
    Lean forward and place the forearms on your thighs with the back of your wrists over your knees. This will be your starting position.
    Lower the bar as far as possible, while inhaling and keeping a tight grip.
    Now curl the bar up as high as possible while contracting the forearms. Tip: Only the wrist should move; not the forearms.
    After a second contraction at the top go back to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can be performed also with a single handle attachment (one arm at a time) or with free weights (barbells or dumbbells) using one arm and two arm variations.

    Back extension

Back extension

The back extension is an exercise used to build lower back strength that also targets the hamstrings and glutes. It is often performed on a 45-degree bench with the feet anchored. Unweighted back extensions are often performed for high reps, such as 15-20 reps or more, but the movement can also be performed with added weight in lower rep ranges, such as 8-12 reps per set.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the hamstrings and glutes
    Increases lower back strength and muscular endurance
    Can be progressed by holding weights or adding band resistance
    Effective posterior chain training without loading the spine, unlike a deadlift or squat

Back extension Instructions
Back extension muscle diagram

    Lie face down on a hyperextension bench, tucking your ankles securely under the footpads.
    Adjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad, leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction.
    With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms.
    Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back.
    Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed without a hyperextension bench, but in this case you will need a spotter. Also, a similar exercise to this one is the good morning and the stiff-legged deadlift.

    Close-grip bench press

Close-grip bench press

The close-grip bench press is a popular exercise targeting the triceps and chest. The main difference between this exercise and the standard bench press is that the hands and elbows are placed closer together, which places more of an emphasis on the triceps. The close-grip bench press is often used as an accessory movement for the traditional bench press, or as a triceps builder for arm training. Similar to the bench press, it can be trained in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle or strength endurance.
Benefits

    Places extra emphasis on the triceps
    Works the chest, particularly the inner chest
    Some lifters find it easier on the shoulders than wider-grip bench variations

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Chest

Close-grip bench press Instructions
Close-grip bench press muscle diagram

    Lie back on a flat bench. Using a close grip (around shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that - as opposed to a regular bench press - you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement.
    After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.

Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed with an e-z bar using the inner handle as well as dumbbells, in which case the palms of the hands will be facing each other.

Cocoons muscle diagram

    Begin by lying on your back on the ground. Your legs should be straight and your arms extended behind your head. This will be your starting position.
    To perform the movement, tuck the knees toward your chest, rotating your pelvis to lift your glutes from the floor. As you do so, flex the spine, bringing your arms back over your head to perform a simultaneous crunch motion.
    After a brief pause, return to the starting position.

    Cross-Body Crunch

Cross-Body Crunch

The elbow-to-knee crunch is a bodyweight exercise targeting the ab muscles, the obliques and rectus abdominis or "six-pack" muscles in particular. It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout.
Benefits

    Strengthens the obliques and rectus abdominis
    Simple exercise that can be done by all fitness levels
    Works well with other ab-focused movements in a circuit

Cross-Body Crunch Instructions
Cross-Body Crunch muscle diagram

    Lie flat on your back and bend your knees about 60 degrees.
    Keep your feet flat on the floor and place your hands loosely behind your head. This will be your starting position.
    Now curl up and bring your right elbow and shoulder across your body while bring your left knee in toward your left shoulder at the same time. Reach with your elbow and try to touch your knee. Exhale as you perform this movement. Tip: Try to bring your shoulder up towards your knee rather than just your elbow and remember that the key is to contract the abs as you perform the movement; not just to move the elbow.
    Now go back down to the starting position as you inhale and repeat with the left elbow and the right knee.
    Continue alternating in this manner until all prescribed repetitions are done.

Variation: You can also do all of your repetitions for one side and then switch to the other side.

    Dumbbell Flyes

Dumbbell Flyes

The dumbbell chest fly is a popular exercise that targets the pectoral or chest muscles. It attempts to isolate the chest muscles, stretching and contracting them while limiting involvement of the shoulders. Unlike a press, where the elbows bend and flex, flyes should keep a relatively consistent elbow angle. The motion is sometimes compared to "hugging a tree." Dumbbell flyes are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a chest or upper-body focused workout.
Benefits

    Works the chest muscles differently than presses
    Great accessory movement on chest day
    Effective chest training even with relatively light weight

Dumbbell Flyes Instructions
Dumbbell Flyes muscle diagram

    Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
    Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position.
    With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.
    Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.
    Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations: You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation.

    Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso.
    The palms of the hands should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.
    Now, while holding your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the weight forward while contracting the biceps. Continue to raise the weight until the biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief moment as you squeeze the biceps. Tip: Focus on keeping the elbow stationary and only moving your forearm.
    After the brief pause, inhale and slowly begin the lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.

Incline dumbbell bench press

The incline dumbbell bench press is a popular upper-body exercise targeting the upper pectoral muscles. While it can be a strength-focused movement, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or chest-focused training.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the pecs
    Targets the upper chest
    Greater range of motion than barbell presses
    Allows for natural shoulder and wrist rotation
    May be more shoulder-friendly than barbell presses

Incline dumbbell bench press Instructions
Incline dumbbell bench press muscle diagram

    Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.
    Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width.
    Once you have the dumbbells raised to shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position.
    Be sure to keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. Then breathe out and push the dumbbells up with your chest.
    Lock your arms at the top, hold for a second, and then start slowly lowering the weight. Tip Ideally, lowering the weights should take about twice as long as raising them.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, place the dumbbells back on your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to release the dumbbells.

Variations: You can use several angles on the incline bench if the bench you are using is adjustable.

Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other.

Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.

    Low-cable cross-over

Low-cable cross-over

The low-cable cross-over is an isolation movement that uses a cable stack to target the upper portion of the pectoral muscles. It is common in upper-body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, often in combination with presses or flyes from other angles to target all portions of the chest.
Benefits

    Unlike dumbbells, cables provide constant tension, including at peak contraction
    Can quickly switch weights for dropsets
    The line of resistance from the cables targets the muscles of the upper pectorals
    Stretches the chest muscles under load which can lead to greater muscle gain

    To move into the starting position, place the pulleys at the low position, select the resistance to be used and grasp a handle in each hand.
    Step forward, gaining tension in the pulleys. Your palms should be facing forward, hands below the waist, and your arms straight. This will be your starting position.
    With a slight bend in your arms, draw your hands upward and toward the midline of your body. Your hands should come together in front of your chest, palms facing up.
    Return your arms back to the starting position after a brief pause.

    Connect a standard handle to a tower. Move cable to highest pulley position.
    Stand with side to cable. With one hand, reach up and grab handle with underhand grip.
    Pull down cable until elbow touches your side and the handle is by your shoulder.
    Position feet hip-width apart. Place free hand on hip to help gauge pivot point.
    Keep arm in static position. Contract oblique to bring the weight down in a side crunch.
    Once you reach maximum contraction, slowly release the weight to the starting position. The weight stack should never be unloaded in a resting position. The aim is constant tension during the set.
    Repeat to failure.
    Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.

Tip: Keep your arm tucked in tight to your side; don’t move it. This technique will ensure the weight is isolated directly to the obliques and not your biceps or shoulder.

    Seated Dumbbell Press

Seated Dumbbell Press

The seated dumbbell shoulder pressis an exercise for building muscle and strengthening the shoulders, particularly but not exclusively the front heads. The triceps also assist. Some lifters feel that using dumbbells versus a barbell reduced injury risk.
Benefits

    One shoulder can�t compensate for the other, like it can during the seated barbell shoulder press
    The range of motion isn�t forced like it is with the seated barbell shoulder press
    Builds shoulder muscle and strength
    Particularly good for the front heads of the shoulder
    Triceps receive a good workout, too

Seated Dumbbell Press muscle diagram

    Grab a couple of dumbbells and sit on a military press bench or a utility bench that has a back support on it as you place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs.
    Clean the dumbbells up one at a time by using your thighs to bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height at each side.
    Rotate the wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing forward. This is your starting position.
    As you exhale, push the dumbbells up until they touch at the top.
    After a second pause, slowly come down back to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    You can perform the exercise standing or sitting on a regular flat bench. For people with lower back problems, the version described is the recommended one.
    You can also perform the exercise as Arnold Schwarzenegger used to do it, which is to start holding the dumbbells with a supinated grip (palms facing you) in front of your shoulders and then, as you start pushing up, you align the dumbbells in the starting position described on step 3 by rotating your wrists and touch the dumbbells at the top. As you come down, then you would go back to the starting position by rotating the wrist throughout the lowering portion until the palms of your hands are facing you. This variation is called the Arnold Press. However, it is not recommended if you have rotator cuff problems.

    Standing dumbbell shoulder press

Standing dumbbell shoulder press

The standing dumbbell shoulder press is a classic deltoid-building exercise that is common in gyms around the world. Performing the move standing up as opposed to seated allows more weight to be used and taxes the core more than seated presses. The standing press is worthy of being the main movement in a muscle-building shoulder workout, but is also a great strength movement and accessory for the bench press.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the shoulders and triceps
    Many people find pressing with dumbbells to be more shoulder-friendly than with barbells
    Develops shoulder strength and stability that carries over to other lifts and sports

    Standing with your feet shoulder width apart, take a dumbbell in each hand. Raise the dumbbells to head height, the elbows out and about 90 degrees. This will be your starting position.
    Maintaining strict technique with no leg drive or leaning back, extend through the elbow to raise the weights together directly above your head.
    Pause, and slowly return the weight to the starting position.

EZ-Bar Curl

The standing EZ-bar curl is an immensely popular exercise targeting the biceps. It is commonly performed for moderate to high reps as part of an upper body or arms-focused workout. Many gyms even have EZ-bars at fixed weights, allowing for easy weight changes.
Benefits

    Many lifters find the EZ-bar easier on the wrists, elbows, and shoulders than a straight bar
    Builds size and strength in biceps
    Easy to make more difficult by controlling tempo or adding pauses

EZ-Bar Curl Instructions
EZ-Bar Curl muscle diagram

    Stand up straight while holding an EZ curl bar at the wide outer handle. The palms of your hands should be facing forward and slightly tilted inward due to the shape of the bar. Keep your elbows close to your torso. This will be your starting position.
    Now, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps. Focus on only moving your forearms.
    Continue to raise the weight until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the top contracted position for a moment and squeeze the biceps.
    Then inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also perform this movement using an E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement.

You may also use the closer grip for variety purposes.

Olympic Squat muscle diagram

    Begin with a barbell supported on top of the traps. The chest should be up, and the head facing forward. Adopt a hip width stance with the feet turned out as needed.
    Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward; ensure that they stay aligned with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as upright as possible. Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel.
    At the moment the upper legs contact the lower, reverse the motion, driving the weight upward.

    Using the leg pad of a lat pulldown machine or a preacher bench, position yourself so that your ankles are under the pads, knees on the seat, and you are facing away from the machine. You should be upright and maintaining good posture.
    This will be your starting position. Lower yourself under control until your knees are almost completely straight.
    Remaining in control, raise yourself back up to the starting position.
    If you are unable to complete a rep, use a band, a partner, or push off of a box to aid in completing a repetition.

    Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an over/under grip.
    With your feet and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and flex the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward.
    After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.
    Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.

    Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell in each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso.
    Make sure the palms of the hands are facing each other. This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Your wrist should rotate so that you have a supinated (palms up) grip. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
    Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
    Now during the contracted position, rotate your wrist until you now have a pronated (palms facing down) grip with the thumb at a higher position than the pinky.
    Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back down using the pronated grip.
    As the dumbbells close your thighs, start rotating the wrist so that you go back to a neutral (palms facing your body) grip.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Glute ham raise-

Glute ham raise-

The glute ham raise is an exercise targeting the glutes and hamstrings on a GHD, or glute ham developer bench. The unassisted version of the movement requires serious hamstring strength, so it is more common to see versions that use a band or PVC pipe for assistance. It is commonly performed as an accessory movement for heavy barbell lifts. While a single rep may be a struggle at first, with time, strong athletes can build up to doing them for 8-12 reps per set.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the hamstrings and glutes
    Also works the core and lower back
    Great accessory movement for a stronger deadlift

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Hamstrings

    You can use a partner for this exercise or brace your feet under something stable.
    Begin on your knees with your upper legs and torso upright. If using a partner, they will firmly hold your feet to keep you in position. This will be your starting position.
    Lower yourself by extending at the knee, taking care to NOT flex the hips as you go forward.
    Place your hands in front of you as you reach the floor. This movement is very difficult and you may be unable to do it unaided. Use your arms to lightly push off the floor to aid your return to the starting position.

    Single-arm lateral raise

Single-arm lateral raise

The single-arm lateral raise is a shoulder exercise that targets the medial or middle head of the deltoid muscle. It's a staple strength-training move and is a great option for accessory work on upper-body training days. Hold on to a post for balance, or do it free-standing to challenge core strength and stability. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per side, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Builds shoulder strength and size, even with light weights
    Can help create balanced shoulder development between sides
    Easy to increase range of motion by holding on to a post and leaning to the side
    Can create better mind-muscle connection than raises using two arms

Single-arm lateral raise Instructions
Single-arm lateral raise muscle diagram

    Pick a dumbbell and place it in one of your hands. Your non lifting hand should be used to grab something steady such as an incline bench press. Lean towards your lifting arm and away from the hand that is gripping the incline bench as this will allow you to keep your balance.
    Stand with a straight torso and have the dumbbell by your side at arm’s length with the palm of the hand facing you. This will be your starting position.
    While maintaining the torso stationary (no swinging), lift the dumbbell to your side with a slight bend on the elbow and your hand slightly tilted forward as if pouring water in a glass. Continue to go up until you arm is parallel to the floor. Exhale as you execute this movement and pause for a second at the top.
    Lower the dumbbell back down slowly to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the exercise.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed sitting down.

Power Partials muscle diagram

    Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso.
    The palms of the hands should be facing your torso. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your arms straight and the torso stationary, lift the weights out to your sides until they are about shoulder level height while exhaling.
    Feel the contraction for a second and begin to lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling. Tip: Keep the palms facing down with the little finger slightly higher while lifting and lowering the weights as it will concentrate the stress on your shoulders mainly.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.

    Triceps
    Cable V-bar push-down

Cable V-bar push-down

The cable V-bar push-down is a popular gym exercise for targeting the triceps. It utilizes an angled bar, which can allow you to move heavier weights more comfortably than a straight bar or rope. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more per set, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.
Benefits

    High level of triceps activation and pump, particularly in the lateral head
    The angled handle may activate triceps to a greater degree than a straight bar
    Allows you to move heavier weight than the rope push-down

    Type: Strength

Cable V-bar push-down muscle diagram

    Attach a V-Bar to a high pulley and grab with an overhand grip (palms facing down) at shoulder width.
    Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. The thumbs should be higher than the small finger. This is your starting position.
    Using the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.
    After a second hold at the contracted position, bring the V-Bar slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a straight cable bar attachment for different variations of the exercise. Also, you can attach a rope to the pulley as well as using a reverse grip on the bar exercises.

Just like the Triceps Pushdown but with the V-Bar attachment.

    To begin, stand straight up grabbing a wrist roller using a pronated grip (palms facing down). Your feet should be shoulder width apart.
    Slowly lift both arms until they are fully extended and parallel to the floor in front of you. Note: Make sure the rope is not wrapped around the roller. Your entire body should be stationary except for the forearms. This is the starting position.
    Rotate one wrist at a time in an upward motion to bring the weight up to the bar by rolling the rope around the roller.
    Once the weight has reached the bar, slowly begin to lower the weight back down by rotating the wrist in a downward motion until the weight reaches the starting position.
    Repeat for the prescribed amount of repetitions in your program.

    Incline dumbbell reverse fly

Incline dumbbell reverse fly

The incline dumbbell reverse fly is an upper-body exercise targeting the posterior or rear deltoids, as well as the postural muscles of the upper back. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the posterior deltoids
    The incline takes away the potential of using momentum, making the movement more challenging
    Helps develop bigger, more balanced, and healthier shoulders
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day
    Works the rhomboids and lower and middle traps

    Type: Strength

    To begin, lie down on an incline bench with the chest and stomach pressing against the incline. Have the dumbbells in each hand with the palms facing each other (neutral grip).
    Extend the arms in front of you so that they are perpendicular to the angle of the bench. The legs should be stationary while applying pressure with the ball of your toes. This is the starting position.
    Maintaining the slight bend of the elbows, move the weights out and away from each other (to the side) in an arc motion while exhaling. Tip: Try to squeeze your shoulder blades together to get the best results from this exercise.
    The arms should be elevated until they are parallel to the floor.
    Feel the contraction and slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Quadriceps
    Stair climber

Stair climber

The stair climber is a popular cardio machine found in most commercial gyms. Along with burning a ton of calories, the stair climber also helps build strength in the lower body, especially the glutes. It can work well at higher speeds for interval-style conditioning training, but also works well at slower paces for steady-state cardio.
Benefits

    Burns a lot of calories
    Easier on the joints than running
    Great for sculpting the legs and glutes

    Type: Cardio
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps
    Equipment: Machine

    To begin, step onto the stepmill and select the desired option from the menu. You can choose a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Use caution so that you don’t trip as you climb the stairs. It is recommended that you maintain your grip on the handles so that you don’t fall.
    Stepmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside while offering a similar rate of calories burned. They are typically much harder than other cardio equipment. A 150 lb person will typically burn over 300 calories in 30 minutes, compared to about 175 calories walking.

    Overhead dumbbell front raise

Overhead dumbbell front raise

The overhead dumbbell front raise takes the dumbbell front raise one step further, extending the motion all the way above the head. In addition to the shoulders, it activates and strengthens the muscles of the traps and upper back. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-15 reps or more. It can be part of a dynamic upper-body warm-up, performed as a muscle-building upper-body movement, or as a burnout movement on shoulder day.
Benefits

    Strengthens and develops the front (anterior) deltoids, traps, and upper back
    Encourages overhead shoulder mobility
    Great high-rep burnout with light weight
    Can also be performed with a weight plate or cable rope handle

    Biceps curl to shoulder press

Biceps curl to shoulder press

The biceps curl to shoulder press is a dumbbell complex that combines two exercises that build and strengthen the biceps and shoulders or deltoids. It is usually performed one rep of each movement at a time, although you could perform more reps of each, or increase the reps in successive rounds (e.g., 1 rep in round 1, 2 reps in round 2, etc.). No matter how you structure the sets and reps, it is a time-efficient way to hit two crucial upper-body muscles in any workout.
Benefits

    Promotes pump and muscle growth in both the biceps and shoulders
    Prolonged muscle time under tension
    Great burnout on an upper-body day

    Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand. Your arms should be hanging at your sides with your palms facing forward. Look directly ahead, keeping your chest up, with your feet shoulder-width apart. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by flexing the elbows to curl the weight. Do not use momentum or flex through the shoulder, instead use a controlled motion.
    Execute the pressing movement by extending the arm, flexing and abducting the shoulder to rotate the arm as you press above your head.
    Pause at the top of the motion before reversing the movement to return to the starting position. Complete the desired number of repetitions before switching to the opposite side.

Weighted bench dip

The weighted bench dip is a highly effective exercise for building the triceps. The resistance comes from a combination of body weight and added weight�usually a weight plate.
Benefits

    Effective for building stronger, more muscular triceps
    Great for burnout sets at the end of an arm workout
    Can alter the range of motion based on shoulder comfort

Weighted bench dip Instructions
Weighted bench dip muscle diagram

    For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back and another one in front of you. With the benches perpendicular to your body, hold on to one bench on its edge with the hands close to your body, separated at shoulder width. Your arms should be fully extended.
    The legs will be extended forward on top of the other bench. Your legs should be parallel to the floor while your torso is to be perpendicular to the floor. Have your partner place the dumbbell on your lap. Note: This exercise is best performed with a partner as placing the weight on your lap can be challenging and cause injury without assistance. This will be your starting position.
    Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down.
    Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position while exhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: By placing your legs on top of another flat bench in front of you, the exercise becomes more challenging. It is best to attempt this exercise without any weights at first in order to get used to the movements required for good form. If that variation also becomes easy, then you can have a partner place plates on top of your lap. Make sure that in this case the partner ensures that the weights stay there throughout the movement.

    Begin seated on the ground with a bench directly behind you. Have a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused by this exercise.
    Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lean back against the bench so that your shoulder blades are near the top of it.
    Begin the movement by driving through your feet, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your shoulder blades and your feet. Extend as far as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position.

    Stand erect with your feet hip-width apart, chest out, and shoulders back, maintaining the natural curvature of your spine. Your knees should be unlocked and your hand on your hips. This is your starting position.
    Take a moderate-length step forward with one foot, descending to a point in which your rear knee approaches the floor without touching, maintaining your body's upright posture. Your front knee should bend about 90 degrees, but for knee health it should not be forward of the vertical plane that extends straight up from your toes. If so, take a slightly longer step.
    From the bottom position, push back up from your forward foot, bringing it back beside the other.
    Repeat on the opposite side for the required number of repetitions.

Barbell Bench Press - Medium Grip muscle diagram

    Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
    From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.
    After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.

Caution:

If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.

Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to touch your middle chest and nowhere else.

Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.

    Chest dip

Chest dip

The chest dip is a bodyweight exercise performed on parallel bars or on a pull-up and dip station. It targets the chest, triceps, and shoulders. Dips with a chest focus are usually performed with the torso leaning forward and the elbows angled out from the torso. Dips can be performed for low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle growth.
Benefits

    Builds muscle and strength in the chest, as well as the triceps and shoulders
    Can add extra weight with a dip belt, dumbbell, or chain
    Serious upper-body training with minimal equipment

Chest dip Instructions
Chest dip muscle diagram

    For this exercise you will need access to parallel bars. To get yourself into the starting position, hold your body at arms length (arms locked) above the bars.
    While breathing in, lower yourself slowly with your torso leaning forward around 30 degrees or so and your elbows flared out slightly until you feel a slight stretch in the chest.
    Once you feel the stretch, use your chest to bring your body back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Remember to squeeze the chest at the top of the movement for a second.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations:

If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a dip assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.

Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.

More advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.

    Seated dumbbell shoulder press

Seated dumbbell shoulder press

The seated dumbbell shoulder press is a popular exercise for building muscle and strength in the shoulders. The triceps also work hard in this lift. Many lifters find using dumbbells to be more comfortable and shoulder-friendly for this press variation than a barbell. This can be the primary pressing movement on an upper-body or shoulder day, or an effective accessory movement later in a workout.
Benefits

    Builds shoulder muscle and strength
    Greater potential range of motion than a barbell press
    Allows natural wrist and arm rotation
    Effective in low and high reps

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Shoulders

Seated dumbbell shoulder press Instructions
Seated dumbbell shoulder press muscle diagram

    While holding a dumbbell in each hand, sit on a military press bench or utility bench that has back support. Place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs.
    Now raise the dumbbells to shoulder height one at a time using your thighs to help propel them up into position.
    Make sure to rotate your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing forward. This is your starting position.
    Now, exhale and push the dumbbells upward until they touch at the top.
    Then, after a brief pause at the top contracted position, slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform the exercise standing or sitting on a regular flat bench. For people with lower back problems, the version described is the recommended one.

You can also perform the exercise as Arnold Schwarzenegger used to do it, which is to start holding the dumbbells with a supinated grip (palms facing you) in front of your shoulders and then, as you start pushing up, you align the dumbbells in the starting position described on step 3 by rotating your wrists and touch the dumbbells at the top. As you come down, then you would go back to the starting position by rotating the wrist throughout the lowering portion until the palms of your hands are facing you. This variation is called the Arnold Press. However, it is not recommended if you have rotator cuff problems.

    Barbell Curl

Barbell Curl

The barbell curl is an arm exercise that is also one of the most recognizable movements in all of bodybuilding and fitness. It helps build sleeve-popping biceps and allows heavier loading than many other curl variations. It is usually performed in moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set, as part of the arm-focused portion of any workout.
Benefits

    Adds strength and size to biceps
    Also helps with forearm and grip strength
    Allows for an intense peak contraction at the midpoint
    Allows for heavier loading than other curl variations

    Type: Strength

Barbell Curl Instructions
Barbell Curl muscle diagram

    Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at a shoulder-width grip. The palm of your hands should be facing forward and the elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Tip: Only the forearms should move.
    Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard.
    Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    You can also perform this movement using a straight bar attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement.
    You may also use the closer grip for variety purposes.

    EZ-Bar Skullcrusher

EZ-Bar Skullcrusher

The EZ-bar skullcrusher is a popular exercise targeting the triceps muscles. The EZ-bar is used more often than a straight bar. As for the name, that�s worst-case scenario. The bar should actually come down behind the head. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of an upper body or arms-focused workout. No need to chase a 1RM on this move!
Benefits

    Builds bigger and stronger triceps
    The EZ-bar is easier on the wrists than a straight bar
    Effective even with relatively light weights

    Using a close grip, lift the EZ bar and hold it with your elbows in as you lie on the bench. Your arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping the upper arms stationary, lower the bar by allowing the elbows to flex. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Pause once the bar is directly above the forehead.
    Lift the bar back to the starting position by extending the elbow and exhaling.
    Repeat.

One-Arm Dumbbell Row muscle diagram

    Choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on each side of it.
    Place the right leg on top of the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support.
    Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.
    Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. Also, make sure that the force is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms.
    Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step.
    Repeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions.
    Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm.

Variations: One-arm rows can also be performed using a high pulley or a low pulley instead of a dumbbell.

    Concentration curl

Concentration curl

The concentration curl is a classic exercise for building the biceps one arm at a time. It can be performed bent over or kneeling, but is more often performed seated on a bench. It's great for emphasizing the biceps peak and is often used to finish a biceps workout. Like most curl variations, these are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Emphasizes strict form and tempo
    Great movement to feel the mind-muscle connection
    Effective arm training even with relatively light weight

Concentration curl Instructions
Concentration curl muscle diagram

    Sit down on a flat bench with one dumbbell in front of you between your legs. Your legs should be spread with your knees bent and feet on the floor.
    Use your right arm to pick the dumbbell up. Place the back of your right upper arm on the top of your inner right thigh. Rotate the palm of your hand until it is facing forward away from your thigh. Tip: Your arm should be extended and the dumbbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Tip: At the top of the movement make sure that the little finger of your arm is higher than your thumb. This guarantees a good contraction. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
    Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in. Caution: Avoid swinging motions at any time.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Then repeat the movement with the left arm.

Variations: This exercise can be performed standing with the torso bent forward and the arm in front of you. In this case, no leg support is used for the back of your arm so you will need to make extra effort to ensure no movement of the upper arm. This is a more challenging version of the exercise and is not recommended for people with lower back issues.

Decline Crunch Instructions
Decline Crunch muscle diagram

    Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down.
    Now place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Don't lock your fingers behind your head.
    While pushing the small of your back down in the bench to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off it.
    Continue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the bench only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the bench. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using momentum.
    After the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: There are many variations for the crunch. You can perform the exercise with weights, or on top of an exercise ball or on a flat bench.

    Works the triceps, anterior delts, and core
    Positioning on the bench makes for better isolation and limiting excess momentum

Decline Dumbbell Flyes muscle diagram

    Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
    Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width. The palms of the hands should be facing each other and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor and fully extended. This will be your starting position.
    With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.
    Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.
    Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variation: You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation.

    Single-arm incline rear delt raise

Single-arm incline rear delt raise

The single-arm incline rear delt raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the posterior deltoids or shoulder muscles, as well as the postural muscles of the upper back. Training each side independently can help correct imbalances in size, strength, and shoulder stability. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the posterior deltoids, one arm at a time
    The incline takes away the potential of using momentum, making the movement more challenging
    Helps develop bigger, more balanced, and healthier shoulders
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day

    Type: Strength

Single-arm incline rear delt raise muscle diagram

    While holding a dumbbell in one hand, lay with your chest down on a slightly inclined (around 15 degrees when measured from the floor) adjustable bench. The other hand can be used to hold to the leg of the bench for stability.
    Position the palm of the hand that is holding the dumbbell in a neutral manner (palms facing your torso) as you keep the arm extended with the elbow slightly bent. This will be your starting position.
    Now raise the arm with the dumbbell to the side until your elbow is at shoulder height and your arm is roughly parallel to the floor as you exhale. Tip: Maintain your arm perpendicular to the torso while keeping your arm extended throughout the movement. Also, keep the contraction at the top for a second.
    Slowly lower the dumbbell to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with both arms at the same time and also keeping the palms of the hands facing back as opposed to facing your torso.

    Alternating dumbbell front raise

Alternating dumbbell front raise

The alternating dumbbell front raise is a single-joint exercise targeting the shoulder muscles, particularly the front or anterior deltoids. Performing the movement one shoulder at a time gives a momentary rest to each side while the other is working, potentially allowing you to do more reps during each set. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.
Benefits

    Strengthens and develops the front (anterior) deltoids
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day
    Can be performed seated or standing

    Pick a couple of dumbbells and stand with a straight torso and the dumbbells on front of your thighs at arms length with the palms of the hand facing your thighs. This will be your starting position.
    While maintaining the torso stationary (no swinging), lift the left dumbbell to the front with a slight bend on the elbow and the palms of the hands always facing down. Continue to go up until you arm is slightly above parallel to the floor. Exhale as you execute this portion of the movement and pause for a second at the top. Inhale after the second pause.
    Now lower the dumbbell back down slowly to the starting position as you simultaneously lift the right dumbbell.
    Continue alternating in this fashion until all of the recommended amount of repetitions have been performed for each arm.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed both arms at the same time. Also, you could use a barbell as well.

    Hanging toes-to-bar

Hanging toes-to-bar

The hanging toes-to-bar is an advanced abdominal exercise in which the lifter touches their feet to a pull-up bar. There are many ways to perform this movement (strict or swinging, arms completely straight or slightly bent, legs straight or bent) each providing unique benefits and challenges. Initially, it may be a difficult move to do for a single rep, but once you build the requisite core, lat, and shoulder strength, it can be performed for higher reps.
Benefits

    Builds serious core strength that carries over to a wide range of lifts
    Forces coordination and co-contraction of the lats, shoulders, core, and hip flexors
    Builds hamstring flexibility when done strictly
    Can be trained in lower strength-focused rep ranges than many other ab exercise

    Hang from a chin-up bar with your legs and feet together using an overhand grip (palms facing away from you) that is slightly wider than shoulder width. Tip: You may use wrist wraps in order to facilitate holding on to the bar.
    Now bend your knees at a 90 degree angle and bring the upper legs forward so that the calves are perpendicular to the floor while the thighs remain parallel to it. This will be your starting position.
    Pull your legs up as you exhale until you almost touch your shins with the bar above you. Tip: Try to straighten your legs as much as possible while at the top.
    Lower your legs as slowly as possible until you reach the starting position. Tip: Avoid swinging and using momentum at all times.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with ankle weights in order to make it more challenging.

    Narrow-stance squat

Narrow-stance squat

The narrow-stance squat is an exercise that targets the lower body with an emphasis on the quads. Many people will find they can't go as deep in a narrow-stance squat as with a wider squat, which is normal. The narrow-stance squat can be performed for time or reps in any workout.
Benefits

    Builds muscular strength and endurance in the hamstrings, glutes, and quads
    Works core and upper-back strength to maintain a neutral spine
    Improves hip mobility to reach proper depth
    Great component of a bodyweight circuit workout

Narrow-stance squat Instructions
Narrow-stance squat muscle diagram

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.
    Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart. Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).
    Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.

Variations:

As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.

You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.

Dumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides. The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used. I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats. (Note: For wide-stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).

Another way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs. This variation is referred to as weight-belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised, but separated platforms, that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems. The issue however is finding the platforms that meet the criteria. The only way I have been able to perform this is when I have two benches placed opposite to each other with spotting platforms that are facing each other. If you move the benches close enough then you get can execute the weight-belt squats by using the spotting platform.

Finally, you can also perform squats in a Smith Machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the Smith Machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against Smith Machine use for squats. If you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.

    Kneeling cable oblique crunch

Kneeling cable oblique crunch

The kneeling cable oblique crunch is a popular core isolation exercise using a rope attachment and cable stack while kneeling on the floor. It primarily targets the obliques and rectus abdominis or "six-pack" muscles, but also strengthens the deep core muscles. It is most commonly performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or higher.
Benefits

    Great way to load abs with weight that can be tracked and increased over time
    The cable provides constant tension on the targeted muscles
    Focuses strictly on the abs without needing to worry about balance or stability

    Connect a rope attachment to a high pulley cable and position the mat on the floor in front of you.
    Take the rope with both hands and kneel approximately 1-2 feet from the column. Position the rope behind your head; your hands being next to your ears. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your hands in place, pull the rope downward in a crunching motion. As you flex the spine, twist to bring your elbow to the opposite knee.
    Pause briefly at the bottom of the motion, and then return to the starting position.

    Reverse Grip Triceps Pushdown

Reverse Grip Triceps Pushdown

The reverse-grip cable straight-bar push-down is a twist on the popular cable straight-bar push-down. The difference has to do with how the hands are positioned holding the bar: the palms facing up rather than down. Because grip will be a limiting factor, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or higher.
Benefits

    Great burnout movement for triceps
    Underhand grip places more stress on the medial head of the triceps
    Builds bigger and stronger triceps

Reverse Grip Triceps Pushdown muscle diagram

    Start by setting a bar attachment (straight or e-z) on a high pulley machine.
    Facing the bar attachment, grab it with the palms facing up (supinated grip) at shoulder width. Lower the bar by using your lats until your arms are fully extended by your sides. Tip: Elbows should be in by your sides and your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position.
    Slowly elevate the bar attachment up as you inhale so it is aligned with your chest. Only the forearms should move and the elbows/upper arms should be stationary by your side at all times.
    Then begin to lower the cable bar back down to the original staring position while exhaling and contracting the triceps hard.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: This exercise can also be performed with a single handle using one arm at a time. This will allow you to better isolate the triceps. With this version you can self spot yourself by placing your hand over your forearm and applying some pressure to help you perform more reps than before.

The bear crawl sled drag is an intense full-body movement that targets the cardiovascular system as well as a wide range of muscle groups, particularly the shoulders, core, and legs. It can be done in short bursts for power or circuit training, or for longer durations as cardiovascular conditioning.
Benefits

    Intense conditioning challenge even with light weight
    Engrains cross-body gait pattern and athletic coordination
    Torches the shoulders, core, legs, arms, and back

Rocky Pull-Ups/Pulldowns muscle diagram

    Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using a wide grip.
    As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
    Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
    After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.
    Now repeat the same movements as described above except this time your torso will remain straight as you go up and the bar will touch the back of the neck instead of the upper chest. Tip: Use the head to lean forward slightly as it will help you properly execute this portion of the exercise.
    Once you have lowered yourself back down to the starting position, repeat the exercise for the prescribed amount of repetitions in your program.

Caution: The behind the neck variation can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck so this exercise is not recommended for people with shoulder problems.

Variations:

    If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.
    Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.
    You can also use a pull-down machine.

Snatch-Grip Behind-The-Neck Overhead Press muscle diagram

    Load a barbell about chest level in a squat rack making sure the apparatus doesn’t impede your hand placement.
    Take a very wide grip on the bar equidistant from the midpoint and place it on your traps as if you were doing a squat.
    Step back from the rack using a shoulder-width stance, feet angled slightly outward, with your knees unlocked and torso upright while maintaining a big chest with your shoulders back. Keep your head facing forward throughout. Lift the bar off your traps; this will be your starting position.
    Keeping your elbows under the bar, press the bar overhead to full arm extension and lower under control without overextending your shoulders and leaning your head forward just a bit. Repeat for reps.

Box Squat with Bands Instructions
Box Squat with Bands muscle diagram

    Begin in a power rack with a box at the appropriate height behind you. Set up the bands on the sleeves, secured to either band pegs, the rack, or dumbbells so that there is appropriate tension. If dumbbells are used, secure them so that they don't move. Also, ensure that the dumbbells you are using are heavy enough for the bands that you are using. Additional plates can be used to hold the dumbbells down. If more tension is needed, you can either widen the base on the floor or choke the bands. Typically, you would aim for a box height that brings you to a parallel squat, but you can train higher or lower if desired.
    Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.
    With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.
    Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe. Use care to return the barbell to the rack.

Flexor Incline Dumbbell Curls Instructions
Flexor Incline Dumbbell Curls muscle diagram

    Hold the dumbbell towards the side farther from you so that you have more weight on the side closest to you. (This can be done for a good effect on all bicep dumbbell exercises). Now do a normal incline dumbbell curl, but keep your wrists as far back as possible so as to neutralize any stress that is placed on them.
    Sit on an incline bench that is angled at 45-degrees while holding a dumbbell on each hand.
    Let your arms hang down on your sides, with the elbows in, and turn the palms of your hands forward with the thumbs pointing away from the body. Tip: You will keep this hand position throughout the movement as there should not be any twisting of the hands as they come up. This will be your starting position.
    Curl up the two dumbbells at the same time until your biceps are fully contracted and exhale. Tip: Do not swing the arms or use momentum. Keep a controlled motion at all times. Hold the contracted position for a second at the top.
    As you inhale, slowly go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Do not extend your arms totally as you could injure your elbows if you hyperextend them. Also, make sure that on the way down you move slowly to avoid injury.

Variations: You can use cables for this movement as well.

Car driver

The car driver is a variation of the plate front raise exercise where the lifter holds a weight plate in front of them and twists it from side to side, similar to a steering wheel. It targets the muscles of the shoulders, the front or anterior deltoids in particular, but is also challenging to the core and upper-back muscles. It can provide variety in a shoulder-focused muscle-building workout or as part of an upper-body or full-body circuit.
Benefits

    Intense shoulder burn, focusing primarily on the front or anterior deltoids
    Neutral grip on plate may be more shoulder-friendly than using a straight bar or dumbbells
    Stabilization challenge to the core and upper back

    While standing upright, hold a barbell plate in both hands at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions. Your palms should be facing each other and your arms should be extended straight out in front of you. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by rotating the plate as far to one side as possible. Use the same type of movement you would use to turn a steering wheel to one side.
    Reverse the motion, turning it all the way to the opposite side.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Benefits

    Serious stretch of the pec muscles
    Far more difficult than most fly variations
    Significant core challenge to stabilize during movement

    Position two equally loaded EZ bars on the ground next to each other. Ensure they are able to roll.
    Assume a push-up position over the bars, supporting your weight on your toes and hands with your arms extended and body straight.
    Place your hands on the bars. This will be your starting position.
    Using a slow and controlled motion, move your hands away from the midline of your body, rolling the bars apart. Inhale during this portion of the motion.
    After moving the bars as far apart as you can, return to the starting position by pulling them back together. Exhale as you perform this movement.

    Standing Calf Raises

Standing Calf Raises

The standing calf raise is a popular movement to target the calf muscles of the lower leg, and in particular the gastrocnemius muscles. When unweighted, it is usually performed for high reps or for time.
Benefits

    Stretches and targets the calf muscles to add size and strength
    Can alter tempo or add pauses to increase intensity
    Can be performed two legs at once, one leg, or alternating
    Can be performed anywhere, any time

    Type: Strength

Standing Calf Raises Instructions
Standing Calf Raises muscle diagram

    Adjust the padded lever of the calf raise machine to fit your height.
    Place your shoulders under the pads provided and position your toes facing forward (or using any of the two other positions described at the beginning of the chapter). The balls of your feet should be secured on top of the calf block with the heels extending off it. Push the lever up by extending your hips and knees until your torso is standing erect. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position.
    Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
    Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury.

Variations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise. A barbell instead of a machine can be used instead as well as dumbbells, one leg or two legs at a time. Refer to the exercise descriptions of these movements below. A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well.

    Lie on the floor face down and place your hands closer than shoulder width for a close hand position. Make sure that you are holding your torso up at arms' length.
    Lower yourself until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale.
    Using your triceps and some of your pectoral muscles, press your upper body back up to the starting position and squeeze your chest. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    After a second pause at the contracted position, repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, you can either bend your legs at the knees to take off resistance or perform the exercise against the wall instead of the floor.
    For the most advanced lifters, you can place your feet at a high surface such as a bench in order to increase the resistance.

    One-Arm Long Bar Row

One-Arm Long Bar Row

The single-arm landmine bent-over row is a barbell exercise focused on the muscles of the middle back, such as the lats (latissimus dorsi) and rhomboids. It also targets the biceps and grip. It utilizes a landmine device which anchors one end of the barbell near the ground, but could also be approximated by placing the barbell in the corner of a room.
Benefits

    An angled bar path is particularly effective at targeting the lat muscles
    Allows heavier loading than a dumbbell row
    Challenges the core and grip
    Can hold the narrow part of the bar, or the collar for more grip challenge
    If grip is a limitation, lifting straps allow heavier loading

    Position a bar into a landmine or in a corner to keep it from moving. Load an appropriate weight onto your end.
    Stand next to the bar, and take a grip with one hand close to the collar. Using your hips and legs, rise to a standing position.
    Assume a bent-knee stance with your hips back and your chest up. Your arm should be extended. This will be your starting position.
    Pull the weight to your side by retracting the shoulder and flexing the elbow. Do not jerk the weight or cheat during the movement.
    After a brief pause, return to the starting position.

    Overhead cable curl

Overhead cable curl

Also known as a crucifix curl, the overhead cable curl is a biceps-focused exercise performed between two cable stacks, using a pair of D-handles. The arms and elbows are held at shoulder height throughout the movement, and both hands curl in toward the ears. This position is designed to eliminate shoulder involvement and momentum, while targeting the biceps peak. This movement is generally done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of arm-focused training.
Benefits

    Builds bigger and more defined biceps
    The cable provides constant tension throughout the movement, including at peak contraction
    Great way to target the biceps peak
    Effective even with light weight

    Type: Strength

    To begin, set a weight that is comfortable on each side of the pulley machine. Note: Make sure that the amount of weight selected is the same on each side.
    Now adjust the height of the pulleys on each side and make sure that they are positioned at a height higher than that of your shoulders.
    Stand in the middle of both sides and use an underhand grip (palms facing towards the ceiling) to grab each handle. Your arms should be fully extended and parallel to the floor with your feet positioned shoulder width apart from each other. Your body should be evenly aligned the handles. This is the starting position.
    While exhaling, slowly squeeze the biceps on each side until your forearms and biceps touch.
    While inhaling, move your forearms back to the starting position. Note: Your entire body is stationary during this exercise except for the forearms.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions prescribed in your program.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed using one handle at a time.

    Single-dumbbell front raise

Single-dumbbell front raise

The single-dumbbell front raise is an isolation movement that targets the shoulders. In particular, it focuses on the anterior or front head of the deltoid muscles. By performing it with one dumbbell at a time, you can focus on each shoulder muscle independently and try to address muscular imbalances between shoulders. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.
Benefits

    Strengthens and develops the front (anterior) deltoids
    Allows you to focus on each shoulder independently
    Adds variety to your shoulder training

    Raise the weight until it is above shoulder level, keeping your arms extended. Your torso and hips should remain stationary throughout the movement.
    Return to the starting position and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Incline cable chest fly

Incline cable chest fly

The incline cable chest fly is an isolation movement that uses a cable stack and an incline bench to target the upper portion of the pectoral muscles. It is common in upper-body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, often after pressing movements like the barbell or dumbbell bench press or as a finishing movement at the end of the workout. It is often used in combination with other flyes to target the chest from different angles.
Benefits

    Unlike dumbbells, cables provide constant tension, including at peak contraction
    Can quickly switch weights for dropsets
    The line of resistance from the cables targets the muscles of the upper pectorals
    Stretches the chest muscles under load which can lead to greater muscle gain

    To get yourself into the starting position, set the pulleys at the floor level (lowest level possible on the machine that is below your torso).
    Place an incline bench (set at 45 degrees) in between the pulleys, select a weight on each one and grab a pulley on each hand.
    With a handle on each hand, lie on the incline bench and bring your hands together at arms length in front of your face. This will be your starting position.
    With a slight bend of your elbows (in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon), lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary. The movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.
    Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and exhale. Hold the contracted position for a second. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variation: You can vary the angle of the bench in order to target the upper chest at slightly different angles.

Single-leg depth squat

The single-leg depth squat is an exercise targeting the muscles of the lower body, including the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. It is sometimes used as a substitute for the pistol squat, since it doesn't demand the same level of flexibility to perform. It is usually performed for low to moderate reps with a focus on proper form and control.
Benefits

    Builds overall leg strength
    Builds core and hip stability and strength
    The range of motion can be limited to match ability level
    Effective substitute for pistol squats, skater squats, or other advanced bodyweight squat variations

    Dumbbell suitcase crunch

Dumbbell suitcase crunch

The dumbbell suitcase crunch is a weighted version of a popular abdominal training exercise. The simple addition of a weight makes the suitcase crunch far more difficult, helping build the "six pack" muscles and providing a different stimulus to the core during training.
Benefits

    Allows you to train in lower rep ranges when bodyweight crunches become too easy
    Weighted ab training can help the core muscles grow and look more defined
    Increases abdominal strength, not just muscle definition

    Begin by lying on your back on the ground. Your legs should be straight and your arms extended behind your head holding a medicine ball. This will be your starting position.
    To perform the movement, tuck the knees toward your chest, rotating your pelvis to lift your glutes from the floor. As you do so, flex the spine, bringing your arms back over your head to perform a simultaneous crunch motion.
    After a brief pause, return to the starting position.

    Lie down on the floor or an exercise mat with your legs fully extended and your upper body upright. Grab the plate by its sides with both hands out in front of your abdominals with your arms slightly bent.
    Slowly cross your legs near your ankles and lift them up off the ground. Your knees should also be bent slightly. Note: Move your upper body back slightly to help keep you balanced turning this exercise. This is the starting position.
    Move the plate to the left side and touch the floor with it. Breathe out as you perform that movement.
    Come back to the starting position as you breathe in and then repeat the movement but this time to the right side of the body. Tip: Use a slow controlled movement at all times. Jerking motions can injure the back.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Single-leg cable hip extension

Single-leg cable hip extension

The single-leg cable hip extension is an isolation exercise that targets the glutes, specifically the gluteus maximus. It is a common burnout movement on a lower-body focused day and is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the gluteus maximus
    Great for hypertrophy or burnout with lighter weight and high reps
    The cable keeps constant tension on the muscles

    Type: Strength

Single-leg cable hip extension Instructions
Single-leg cable hip extension muscle diagram

    Hook a leather ankle cuff to a low cable pulley and then attach the cuff to your ankle.
    Face the weight stack from a distance of about two feet, grasping the steel frame for support.
    While keeping your knees and hips bent slightly and your abs tight, contract your glutes to slowly "kick" the working leg back in a semicircular arc as high as it will comfortably go as you breathe out. Tip: At full extension, squeeze your glutes for a second in order to achieve a peak contraction.
    Now slowly bring your working leg forward, resisting the pull of the cable until you reach the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Switch legs and repeat the movement for the other side.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with exercise bands.

Weighted Jump Squat Instructions
Weighted Jump Squat muscle diagram

    Position a lightly loaded barbell across the back of your shoulders. You could also use a weighted vest, sandbag, or other type of resistance for this exercise.
    The weight should be light enough that it doesn't slow you down significantly. Your feet should be just outside of shoulder width with your head and chest up. This will be your starting position.
    Using a countermovement, squat partially down and immediately reverse your direction to explode off of the ground, extending through your hips, knees, and ankles. Maintain good posture throughout the jump.
    As you return to the ground, absorb the impact through your legs.

Squat with Chains Instructions
Squat with Chains muscle diagram

    To set up the chains, begin by looping the leader chain over the sleeves of the bar. The heavy chain should be attached using a snap hook. Adjust the length of the lead chain so that a few links are still on the floor at the top of the movement.
    Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wide for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings. Keep your head facing forward.
    With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips as much as possible. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Lower bar position necessitates a greater torso lean to keep the bar over the heels. Continue until you break parallel, which is defined as the crease of the hip being in line with the top of the knee.
    Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe, until you have returned to the starting position.

Gorilla Chin/Crunch Instructions
Gorilla Chin/Crunch muscle diagram

    Hang from a chin-up bar using an underhand grip (palms facing you) that is slightly wider than shoulder width.
    Now bend your knees at a 90 degree angle so that the calves are parallel to the floor while the thighs remain perpendicular to it. This will be your starting position.
    As you exhale, pull yourself up while crunching your knees up at the same time until your knees are at chest level. You will stop going up as soon as your nose is at the same level as the bar. Tip: When you get to this point you should also be finishing the crunch at the same time.
    Slowly start to inhale as you return to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also add resistance by holding a dumbbell or medicine ball between your feet but this should only be done by the most advanced athletes. Alternatively, when you are very advanced you can also try the one-arm version where you grasp your wrist with your free hand and you work the obliques more.

    Kneeling cable triceps extension

Kneeling cable triceps extension

The kneeling cable triceps extension is a single-joint exercise meant to isolate the triceps muscles using a high pully on a cable stack and a bench. It can also be performed in a tall-kneeling stance from a low pully. It is most commonly used in muscle-building triceps or arm workouts.
Benefits

    Emphasizes stretching the triceps under load, which can increase muscle growth
    Cables provide constant tension throughout movement, including at peak contraction
    Easy to change weights for dropsets
    Stabilizing your elbows against the bench can make it easier to focus on the mind-muscle connection

    Place a bench sideways in front of a high pulley machine.
    Hold a straight bar attachment above your head with your hands about 6 inches apart with your palms facing down.
    Face away from the machine and kneel.
    Place your head and the back of your upper arms on the bench. Your elbows should be bent with the forearms pointing towards the high pulley. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping your upper arms close to your head at all times with the elbows in, press the bar out in a semicircular motion until the elbows are locked and your arms are parallel to the floor. Contract the triceps hard and keep this position for a second. Exhale as you perform this movement.
    Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: You can also perform this exercise with exercise bands.

    Connect a rope attachment to a high pulley cable and position a mat on the floor in front of it.
    Grab the rope with both hands and kneel approximately two feet back from the tower.
    Position the rope behind your head with your hands by your ears.
    Keep your hands in the same place, contract your abs and pull downward on the rope in a crunching movement until your elbows reach your knees.
    Pause briefly at the bottom and rise up in a slow and controlled manner until you reach the starting position.
    Repeat the same downward movement until you’re halfway down, at which time you’ll begin rotating one of your elbows to the opposite knee.
    Again, pause briefly at the bottom and rise up in a slow and controlled manner until you reach the starting position.
    Repeat the same movement as before, but alternate the other elbow to the opposite knee.
    Continue this series of movements to failure.

Tip: Keep your elbows in tight when doing the normal crunching movement, but extend them outward when doing the oblique twist. This technique will open your body for a greater rotation, as well as allow your elbow to drive backward with more force.

    To begin, seat yourself on the bike and adjust the seat to your height. Wear protective gear to avoid possible injury. Ensure that you are courteous to vehicles and pedestrians, and that you obey the rules of the road.

Cycling offers convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and has less impact than other activities. A 150 lb person will burn about 280 calories cycling at a moderate rate for 30 minutes, compared to 450 calories or more running.

    Arnold press

Arnold press

Named after the iconic bodybuilder and movie star, the Arnold press adds rotation to a classic shoulder press. It allows the hands to rotate naturally, while also hitting all three heads of the deltoids in one motion. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Great for adding mass to the shoulders
    May be more shoulder-friendly than palms-forward presses
    Great main movement on shoulder day or accessory move for other presses

    Type: Strength

Arnold press Instructions
Arnold press muscle diagram

    Sit on an exercise bench with back support and hold two dumbbells in front of you at about upper chest level with your palms facing your body and your elbows bent. Tip: Your arms should be next to your torso. The starting position should look like the contracted portion of a dumbbell curl.
    Now to perform the movement, raise the dumbbells as you rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward.
    Continue lifting the dumbbells until your arms are extended above you in straight arm position. Breathe out as you perform this portion of the movement.
    After a second pause at the top, begin to lower the dumbbells to the original position by rotating the palms of your hands towards you. Tip: The left arm will be rotated in a counter clockwise manner while the right one will be rotated clockwise. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform the exercise standing up but that is not recommended for people with lower back issues.

    Weighted Crunches

Weighted Crunches

The weighted suitcase crunch is a weighted version of a popular abdominal training exercise. The simple addition of a weight makes the suitcase crunch far more difficult, helping build the "six pack" muscles and providing a different stimulus to the core during training.
Benefits

    Allows you to train in lower rep ranges when bodyweight crunches become too easy
    Weighted ab training can help the core muscles grow and look more defined
    Increases abdominal strength, not just muscle definition

    Lie flat on your back with your feet flat on the ground or resting on a bench with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle.
    Hold a weight to your chest, or you may hold it extended above your torso. This will be your starting position.
    Now, exhale and slowly begin to roll your shoulders off the floor. Your shoulders should come up off the floor about 4 inches while your lower back remains on the floor.
    At the top of the movement, flex your abdominals and hold for a brief pause.
    Then inhale and slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position.

Single-arm cable triceps extension

The single-arm cable triceps extension is a single-joint isolation exercise for building the triceps. It involves driving a handle attached to a cable stack overhead to full extension. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.
Benefits

    Builds stronger and more muscular triceps
    Targets the medial head of the triceps specifically
    The cable provides continuous tension throughout each rep

Single-arm cable triceps extension Instructions
Single-arm cable triceps extension muscle diagram

    With your right hand, grasp a single handle attached to the high-cable pulley using a supinated (underhand; palms facing up) grip. You should be standing directly in front of the weight stack.
    Now pull the handle down so that your upper arm and elbow are locked in to the side of your body. Your upper arm and forearm should form an acute angle (less than 90-degrees). You can keep the other arm by the waist and you can have one leg in front of you and the other one back for better balance. This will be your starting position.
    As you contract the triceps, move the single handle attachment down to your side until your arm is straight. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Your upper arms should remain stationary at all times.
    Squeeze the triceps and hold for a second in this contracted position.
    Slowly return the handle to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the other arm.

Variations: You can use exercise bands to perform this exercise.

    Barbell roll-out

Barbell roll-out

The barbell roll-out is an abdominal exercise that utilizes a barbell in the place of an ab roller. It is best performed with a barbell that has rotating collars, and is considered more difficult than other ab roller variations. Many lifters may not be able to perform a single rep at first, but once they can perform these for reps, they'll be rewarded with a seriously strong core.
Benefits

    Works core strength and stability
    Engages all muscle groups of the core
    Encourages coordination, mobility, and lumbar positioning
    Unlike with an ab roller, grip width can be altered based on shoulder comfort

    Type: Strength

Barbell roll-out Instructions
Barbell roll-out muscle diagram

    For this exercise you will need to get into a pushup position, but instead of having your hands of the floor, you will be grabbing on to an Olympic barbell (loaded with 5-10 lbs on each side) instead. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping a slight arch on your back, lift your hips and roll the barbell towards your feet as you exhale. Tip: As you perform the movement, your glutes should be coming up, you should be keeping the abs tight and should maintain your back posture at all times. Also your arms should be staying perpendicular to the floor throughout the movement. If you don't, you will work out your shoulders and back more than the abs.
    After a second contraction at the top, start to roll the barbell back forward to the starting position slowly as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is a challenging exercise for people with healthy backs.

Variation: This is an exercise that, just like the push-up, can also be done on the knees for less advanced athletes.

    Kneeling cable crunch

Kneeling cable crunch

The kneeling cable crunch is a popular core isolation exercise using a rope attachment and cable stack while kneeling on the floor. It primarily targets the rectus abdominis or "six-pack" muscles, but also strengthens the deep core muscles. It is most commonly performed early in an ab workout, usually in moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or higher.
Benefits

    Great way to load abs with weight that can be tracked and increased over time
    Greater range of motion than a traditional sit-up or crunch
    Weighted ab training can increase core definition in addition to strength

    Type: Strength

Kneeling cable crunch Instructions
Kneeling cable crunch muscle diagram

    Kneel below a high pulley that contains a rope attachment.
    Grasp cable rope attachment and lower the rope until your hands are placed next to your face.
    Flex your hips slightly and allow the weight to hyperextend the lower back. This will be your starting position.
    With the hips stationary, flex the waist as you contract the abs so that the elbows travel towards the middle of the thighs. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and hold the contraction for a second.
    Slowly return to the starting position as you inhale. Tip: Make sure that you keep constant tension on the abs throughout the movement. Also, do not choose a weight so heavy that the lower back handles the brunt of the work.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with a handle instead so that you can concentrate on each side of the abs separately by performing the exercise to the side.

    Place an exercise ball nearby and lay on the floor in front of it with your hands on the floor shoulder width apart in a push-up position.
    Now place your lower shins on top of an exercise ball. Tip: At this point your legs should be fully extended with the shins on top of the ball and the upper body should be in a push-up type of position being supported by your two extended arms in front of you. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping your back completely straight and the upper body stationary, pull your knees in towards your chest as you exhale, allowing the ball to roll forward under your ankles. Squeeze your abs and hold that position for a second.
    Now slowly straighten your legs, rolling the ball back to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Hanging leg raise

Hanging leg raise

The hanging leg raise is an exercise targeting the abs, but which also works the lats and hip flexors. Instead of resting your forearms on the pads of a captain's chair, you perform these hanging from a bar. Experienced lifters make these look easy, but beginners may need time to build up to sets of 8-12 reps.
Benefits

    Higher degree of difficulty than with the captain's chair or parallel bars
    Emphasizes the lower part of the rectus abdominis or "six-pack" muscles
    Can be performed anywhere with a bar to hang from
    Can be the main focus of a minimalist core routine
    Builds grip, hamstring flexibility, and straight-arm pulling strength

    Type: Strength

Hanging leg raise Instructions
Hanging leg raise muscle diagram

    Hang from a chin-up bar with both arms extended at arms length in top of you using either a wide grip or a medium grip. The legs should be straight down with the pelvis rolled slightly backwards. This will be your starting position.
    Raise your legs until the torso makes a 90-degree angle with the legs. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second or so.
    Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Perform this exercise slowly and deliberately as it takes some getting used to. Also, do not be hasty and try to use weights on the first time; you'll have enough in your hands by holding your weight and also learning how to balance yourself so that you avoid swinging your torso. As you get more advanced you can hold a dumbbell in between your feet. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise as if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a vertical bench that makes the exercise easier by supporting your upper back in place and by allowing you to hold yourself by placing your elbows and arms on the side pads.

    Hold an Olympic barbell loaded with 5-10lbs on each side and kneel on the floor.
    Now place the barbell on the floor in front of you so that you are on all your hands and knees (as in a kneeling push up position). This will be your starting position.
    Slowly roll the barbell straight forward, stretching your body into a straight position. Tip: Go down as far as you can without touching the floor with your body. Breathe in during this portion of the movement.
    After a second pause at the stretched position, start pulling yourself back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Go slowly and keep your abs tight at all times.

Caution: This exercise is for advanced level athletes only. It is also not advised for people with lower back problems or hernias.

Variations: If you are really advanced you can perform the exercise without the knees bent.

Barbell Squat

The barbell back squat is a popular compound movement that emphasizes building the lower-body muscle groups and overall strength. It's the classic way to start a leg day, and is a worthy centerpiece to a lower-body training program. The squat is a competitive lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also a classic measurement of lower-body strength. With the barbell racked on the traps or upper back, the emphasis is placed on the posterior chain but the entire body gets worked. The back squat can be trained in everything from heavy singles to sets of 20 reps or higher.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    Requires back and core strength to maintain torso positioning
    Can be used to improve conditioning and cardiovascular health
    Considered by many to be "the king of exercises"

Barbell Squat Instructions
Barbell Squat muscle diagram

    Begin with the barbell supported on top of the traps. The chest should be up and the head facing forward. Adopt a hip-width stance with the feet turned out as needed.
    Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward. Ensure that they stay align with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as upright as possible.
    Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel. At the moment the upper legs contact the lower legs reverse the motion, driving the weight upward.

Decline barbell bench press

The decline barbell bench press is a popular upper-body exercise targeting the lower pectoral muscles. While it can be a strength-focused movement, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or chest-focused training.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the pecs
    Targets the lower chest
    May be more shoulder-friendly than the flat bench for certain lifters

Decline barbell bench press Instructions
Decline barbell bench press muscle diagram

    Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench.
    Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack.
    As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your lower chest.
    After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up).
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.

Caution:

    If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.
    Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to touch your lower chest and nowhere else.
    Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.

Variations: You can also use dumbbells or exercise bands to perform this exercise.

Dumbbell Bicep Curl muscle diagram

    Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand at arm's length. Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward. This will be your starting position.
    Now, keeping the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
    Then, inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.

You can also do the exercise starting with both palms of the hands facing the torso and then rotating forward as the movement is performed. At the top of the movement the palms should face forward and the small finger should be higher than the thumb for a peak contraction.

Dumbbell Goblet Squat Instructions
Dumbbell Goblet Squat muscle diagram

    From a standing position cradle the head of a dumbbell close to your chest with both hands. You should be looking straight forward, with your shoulders back, your spine straight, and your feet just outside of shoulder width. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by descending into a squat, flexing the hips and knees to lower your body. Maintain the angle of your torso, paying close attention to the preservation of your spine. As you descend, push your knees outward and keep your weight on your heels.
    Descend until you either reach the full squat position with your hamstrings on your calves or until your back starts to round. At the bottom of the motion pause briefly.
    Return to the starting position by driving through your heels, extending the knees and hips to return to the starting position. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.

    Quadriceps
    Dumbbell squat

Dumbbell squat

The dumbbell squat is a classic lower-body exercise that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. While this variation is usually performed with relatively light weights for high reps, it can also be used as a substitute for squats or the trap-bar deadlift in any workout.
Benefits

    Strengthens the legs, back, and grip
    Forces the core to stabilize while lower body moves
    Doesn't heavily load the top of the spine like back squats do

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps
    Equipment: Dumbbell

Dumbbell squat Instructions
Dumbbell squat muscle diagram

    Stand up straight while holding a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing the side of your legs).
    Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.
    Begin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
    Begin to raise your torso as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. You may use wrist wraps for this exercise.

Variations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.

You can also use a barbell for this exercise.

    Quadriceps
    Barbell front squat

Barbell front squat

The barbell front squat is a compound movement that emphasizes building the lower-body muscle groups. With the barbell racked in front of the body on the anterior delts, the front squat emphasizes the quads and glutes, but also upper back and core strength to remain upright. Front squats can be trained as an alternative to back squats, as an accessory movement for either squats or deadlifts, or for strength and muscle on their own. Many lifters and athletes prefer them to back squats, although they can be uncomfortable and difficult to learn at first.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    Builds upper-back and core strength to stay upright
    Encourages good mobility in the hips, shoulders, ankles
    May be more spine-friendly than back squats
    Multiple grip options: rack, crossed arms, "zombie" arms, or holding onto straps that are wrapped around the bar

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps
    Equipment: Barbell
    Level: Intermediate

Barbell front squat Instructions
Barbell front squat muscle diagram

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.
    Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).
    Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The front squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. This version of the squat is better suited for advanced athletes.

Variations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize. You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.

    Close-grip pull-down

Close-grip pull-down

The close-grip pull-down is a variation on the lat pull-down that is performed with an overhand grip and the hands slightly closer than shoulder-width apart. This increases the range of motion beyond wider grips, and may increase the time under tension in each rep. This variation is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of a back or upper-body workout.
Benefits

    Emphasizes the middle of the back
    Easy to learn and execute
    Cables provide constant tension on the targeted muscles

Close-grip pull-down Instructions
Close-grip pull-down muscle diagram

    Sit down on a pull-down machine with a V-Bar attached to the top pulley.
    Adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
    Grab the V-bar with the palms facing each other (a neutral grip). Stick your chest out and lean yourself back slightly (around 30-degrees) in order to better engage the lats. This will be your starting position.
    Using your lats, pull the bar down as you squeeze your shoulder blades. Continue until your chest nearly touches the V-bar. Exhale as you execute this motion. Tip: Keep the torso stationary throughout the movement.
    After a second hold on the contracted position, slowly bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.

Caution: Avoid the temptation to use a weight so big that you need to start swinging your torso in order to perform the exercise.

    Triceps Pushdown - Rope Attachment

Triceps Pushdown - Rope Attachment

The cable rope push-down is a popular exercise targeting the triceps muscles. It's easy to learn and perform, making it a favorite for everyone from beginners to advanced lifters. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more per set, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.
Benefits

    High level of triceps activation and pump, particularly in the lateral head
    The rope handle may activate triceps to a greater degree than a straight bar
    Can dial in focus on long head of triceps by leaning forward slightly during the movement

Triceps Pushdown - Rope Attachment Instructions
Triceps Pushdown - Rope Attachment muscle diagram

    Attach a rope attachment to a high pulley and grab with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).
    Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the rope with the palms facing each other. This is your starting position.
    Using the triceps, bring the rope down as you bring each side of the rope to the side of your thighs. At the end of the movement the arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.
    After holding for a second, at the contracted position, bring the rope slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a V-angled bar or straight bar.

Same as the Triceps Pushdown except with the rope attachment.

    Smith machine shoulder press

Smith machine shoulder press

The Smith machine shoulder press is a machine-based exercise targeting the deltoid muscles. The Smith machine mimics a barbell but provides more stability. This movement can be programmed in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle and strength endurance. It is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a shoulder or upper-body focused workout.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the shoulders
    Can press intensely without fear of dropping the bar
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to get into position and control

    To begin, place a flat bench (or preferably one with back support) underneath a smith machine. Position the barbell at a height so that when seated on the flat bench, the arms must be almost fully extended to reach the barbell.
    Once you have the correct height, sit slightly in behind the barbell so that there is an imaginary straight line from the tip of your nose to the barbell. Your feet should be stationary. Grab the barbell with the palms facing forward, unlock it and lift it up so that your arms are fully extended. This is the starting position.
    Slowly begin to lower the barbell until it is level with your chin while inhaling.
    Then lift the barbell back to the starting position using your shoulders while exhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: You can use dumbbells or a barbell to perform this exercise.

    Seated triceps press

Seated triceps press

The seated triceps press is a popular arm-building exercise that targets the triceps with a single dumbbell held by both hands, extending it up behind your head. While you can go surprisingly heavy on this movement, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or arm-focused portion of a workout. If you're going heavy, having someone help get the weight into position is a good idea.
Benefits

    Builds stronger and bigger triceps
    Great way to target the long head of the triceps
    Can go heavier than other triceps isolation movements
    Performing this move seated eliminates any balance challenge and allows you to focus on the triceps

Seated triceps press Instructions
Seated triceps press muscle diagram

    Sit down on a bench with back support and grasp a dumbbell with both hands and hold it overhead at arm's length. Tip: a better way is to have somebody hand it to you especially if it is very heavy. The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hand should be facing inward. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semi-circular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.
    Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    You can perform this exercise standing as well but this puts strain on your back especially if you are using heavy dumbbells like 95 lbs or so.
    Another variation is to use an EZ or straight bar instead in which case you will be holding the bar from the inside (around 5 inches between both hands) with the palms facing forward (pronated grip).
    There is also a bar that has parallel bars inside (often referred to as a triceps blaster) and this can also be used for this exercise.
    Finally, a low pulley cable with a rope attachment or bar (straight or EZ) attachment at the end can be used for variety purposes as well.

Dumbbell Lying Supination Instructions
Dumbbell Lying Supination muscle diagram

    Lie sideways on a flat bench with one arm holding a dumbbell and the other hand on top of the bench folded so that you can rest your head on it.
    Bend the elbows of the arm holding the dumbbell so that it creates a 90-degree angle between the upper arm and the forearm.
    Now raise the upper arm so that the forearm is parallel to the floor and perpendicular to your torso (Tip: So the forearm will be directly in front of you). The upper arm will be stationary by your torso and should be parallel to the floor (aligned with your torso at all times). This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe out, externally rotate your forearm so that the dumbbell is lifted up in a semicircle motion as you maintain the 90 degree angle bend between the upper arms and the forearm. You will continue this external rotation until the forearm is perpendicular to the floor and the torso pointing towards the ceiling. At this point you will hold the contraction for a second.
    As you breathe in, slowly go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then switch to the other arm.

Caution: There is no need to go heavy with this exercise. Too much weight will cause rotator cuff injury.

Variations: You can perform this exercise standing and with cables.

Pull-up

The pull-up is a multijoint bodyweight exercise that builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core. It is often used as a measurement tool in military or tactical fitness tests, and is an excellent gauge of "relative strength" which is strength in relation to body weight.
Benefits

    Strengthens the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), biceps, upper back, core, and grip
    Requires no equipment other than a bar
    Can build absolute strength for low reps, or strength endurance for higher reps
    Easy to alter grip style and width to target different muscles or rep ranges

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Lats

    Take a wide grip on a pull-up bar, hanging freely with your arms extended. This will be your starting position.
    Pull yourself up by flexing the elbows and adducting the glenohumeral joint. Do not swing or use momentum to complete the movement. Attempt to get your chin above your hands.
    Pause at the top of the motion before lowering yourself to the starting position.

    Chest
    Wide-grip bench press

Wide-grip bench press

The wide-grip bench press is a compound exercise targeting the chest and, to a lesser extent, the triceps. The main difference between this exercise and the standard bench press is that the hands are placed farther apart on the bar. Many lifters find they can handle more weight going wide than with narrower grips, although it's also worth noting that plenty of banged-up lifters have said benching with a wide grip may also have contributed to their shoulder injuries and pain. The wide-grip bench is often used as a chest-building movement in chest or upper-body workouts, or as an accessory movement for the traditional bench press.
Benefits

    Targets the chest even more than the standard bench press
    May enable lifters to handle more weight
    Shortens the range of motion of the lift

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Chest
    Equipment: Barbell

Wide-grip bench press Instructions
Wide-grip bench press muscle diagram

    Lie back on a flat bench with feet firm on the floor. Using a wide, pronated (palms forward) grip that is around 3 inches away from shoulder width (for each hand), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. The bar will be perpendicular to the torso and the floor. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest.
    After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Caution:

    If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.
    Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else.
    Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.

Variations: You can use dumbbells for this exercise as well as exercise bands.

Same as the Barbell Bench Press but with a different grip.

    Close-grip EZ-bar curl

Close-grip EZ-bar curl

The close-grip EZ-bar curl is an exercise targeting the biceps, particularly the long head. The main difference between this exercise and standard EZ-bar curls is that the hands are positioned closer together on the bar. It is thought that this helps build the outer biceps head and the peak. This curl variation is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set.
Benefits

    Builds bigger and stronger biceps
    Targets the long head of the biceps, which makes up the biceps peak
    Many lifters find the EZ-bar easier on the wrists, elbows, and shoulders than a straight bar

    Type: Strength

Close-grip EZ-bar curl Instructions
Close-grip EZ-bar curl muscle diagram

    Stand up with your torso upright while holding an E-Z Curl Bar at the closer inner handle. The palm of your hands should be facing forward and they should be slightly tilted inwards due to the shape of the bar. The elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Tip: Only the forearms should move.
    Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard.
    Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    You can also perform this movement using an E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement.
    You may also use the wider grip for variety purposes.

    Load the bar to an appropriate weight for your training. Stand astride the bar and bend at the hips to take a pronated grip on the handles.
    Ensure that your back remains flat, and then remove the weight from the rests, letting the bar hang at arms length. This will be your starting position.
    Perform the movement by flexing the elbows and retracting the shoulder blades, pulling the weight to your chest.
    After a brief pause at the top of the motion, return to the starting position.

Bent Over Two-Arm Long Bar Row muscle diagram

    Put weight on one of the ends of an Olympic barbell. Make sure that you either place the other end of the barbell in the corner of two walls; or put a heavy object on the ground so the barbell cannot slide backward.
    Bend forward until your torso is as close to parallel with the floor as you can and keep your knees slightly bent.
    Now grab the bar with both arms just behind the plates on the side where the weight was placed and put your other hand on your knee. This will be your starting position.
    Pull the bar straight up with your elbows in (to maximize back stimulation) until the plates touch your lower chest. Squeeze the back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold for a second at the top of the movement. Breathe out as you lift the weight. Tip: Use a stirrup or double handle cable attachment by hooking it under the end of the bar.
    Slowly lower the bar to the starting position getting a nice stretch on the lats. Tip: Do not let the plates touch the floor. To ensure the best range of motion, I recommend using small plates (25-lb ones) as opposed to larger plates (like 35-45lb ones).
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise using a low pulley or T-bar row machine.

    Grip the rings using a false grip, with the base of your palms on top of the rings. Initiate a pull up by pulling the elbows down to your side, flexing the elbows.
    As you reach the top position of the pull-up, pull the rings to your armpits as you roll your shoulders forward, allowing your elbows to move straight back behind you. This puts you into the proper position to continue into the dip portion of the movement.
    Maintaining control and stability, extend through the elbow to complete the motion.
    Use care when lowering yourself to the ground.

Machine shoulder press

The machine shoulder press is a machine-based exercise targeting the deltoid muscles. It approximates the motion of a free-weight shoulder press, but uses a selectorized weight-stack or plate-loaded machine. Many such machines also allow you to choose between different grips and grip widths. Machine shoulder presses are often done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the deltoids
    The machine allows for controlled reps and strict form
    Easy to change weight for dropsets
    Safe way to push intensity and weight

    Load an appropriate weight onto the pins and adjust the seat for your height. The handles should be near the top of the shoulders at the beginning of the motion. Your chest and head should be up and handles held with a pronated grip. This will be your starting position.
    Press the handles upward by extending through the elbow.
    After a brief pause at the top, return the weight to just above the start position, keeping tension on the muscles by not returning the weight to the stops until the set is complete.

    Incline EZ-bar skullcrusher

Incline EZ-bar skullcrusher

The incline EZ-bar skullcrusher is a popular exercise targeting the triceps muscles. The incline angle helps to target the long head of the triceps in particular. This exercise is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.
Benefits

    Builds bigger and stronger triceps
    The EZ-bar is easier on the wrists than a straight bar
    Great stretch and activation on all three heads of the triceps, but the long head in particular

    Hold a barbell with an overhand grip (palms down) that is a little closer together than shoulder width.
    Lie back on an incline bench set at any angle between 45-75-degrees.
    Bring the bar overhead with your arms extended and elbows in. The arms should be in line with the torso above the head. This will be your starting position.
    Now lower the bar in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Inhale as you perform this movement. Tip: Keep your upper arms stationary and close to your head at all times. Only the forearms should move.
    Return to the starting position as you breathe out and you contract the triceps. Hold the contraction for a second.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: Can also be done with an e-z bar, with two dumbbells (using a pronated or supinated grip), seated or standing or with two dumbbells and your palms facing in.

    Alternating sit-through with crunch

Alternating sit-through with crunch

The alternating sit-through with crunch is a full-body movement that starts in a bear crawl position and ends with a leg kicked out to the side. In between reps, you perform a crunch. It is commonly performed for reps or time in bodyweight circuits and animal-style flows, but can also work on its own or as part of a dynamic warm-up or mobility sequence.
Benefits

    Builds strength and size in the shoulders and chest
    Increases core strength and stability
    Trains shoulder extension and stability
    Greater challenge to the rectus abdominis or "six-pack" muscles than traditional sit-throughs

    Pull the bar straight up with your elbow in (to maximize back stimulation) until the plates touch your lower chest. Squeeze the back muscles as you lift the weight up and hold for a second at the top of the movement. Breathe out as you lift the weight. Tip: Do not allow for any swinging of the torso. Only the arm should move.
    Slowly lower the bar to the starting position getting a nice stretch on the lats. Tip: Do not let the plates touch the floor. To ensure the best range of motion, I recommend using small plates (25-lb ones) as opposed to larger plates (like 35-45lb ones).
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and switch arms.

Variations: You can perform this exercise using a low pulley.

Wide-Grip Decline Barbell Bench Press Instructions
Wide-Grip Decline Barbell Bench Press muscle diagram

    Lie back on a decline bench with the feet securely locked at the front of the bench. Using a wide, pronated (palms forward) grip that is around 3 inches away from shoulder width (for each hand), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. The bar will be perpendicular to the torso and the floor. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your lower chest.
    After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Caution:

    If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.
    Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else.
    Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.

Variations: You can use dumbbells for this exercise as well as exercise bands.

Same as the Decline Barbell Bench Press but with a wider grip.

Rower Instructions
Rower muscle diagram

    To begin, seat yourself on the rower. Make sure that your heels are resting comfortably against the base of the foot pedals and that the straps are secured. Select the program that you wish to use, if applicable. Sit up straight and bend forward at the hips.
    There are three phases of movement when using a rower. The first phase is when you come forward on the rower. Your knees are bent and against your chest. Your upper body is leaning slightly forward while still maintaining good posture.Next, push against the foot pedals and extend your legs while bringing your hands to your upper abdominal area, squeezing your shoulders back as you do so. To avoid straining your back, use primarily your leg and hip muscles.
    The recovery phase simply involves straightening your arms, bending the knees, and bringing your body forward again as you transition back into the first phase.

Snatch Deadlift Instructions
Snatch Deadlift muscle diagram

    The snatch deadlift strengthens the first pull of the snatch. Begin with a wide snatch grip with the barbell placed on the platform. The feet should be directly under the hips, with the feet turned out. Squat down to the bar, keeping the back in absolute extension with the head facing forward.
    Initiate the movement by driving through the heels, raising the hips. The back angle should remain the same until the bar passes the knees.
    At that point, drive your hips through the bar as you lay back. Return the bar to the platform by reversing the motion.

    Front Plate Raise

Front Plate Raise

The plate front raise is a variation of the dumbbell front raise where the lifter holds a weight plate between two hands, rather than using a dumbbell, barbell, or other weight. It can provide variety in a shoulder-focused muscle-building workout, or as part of an upper body or full-body circuit.
Benefits

    Intense shoulder burn focusing primarily on the front or anterior deltoids
    More difficult than a standard dumbbell front raise, allowing greater challenge with less weight

    Type: Strength

Front Plate Raise Instructions
Front Plate Raise muscle diagram

    While standing straight, hold a barbell plate in both hands at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions. Your palms should be facing each other and your arms should be extended and locked with a slight bend at the elbows and the plate should be down near your waist in front of you as far as you can go. Tip: The arms will remain in this position throughout the exercise. This will be your starting position.
    Slowly raise the plate as you exhale until it is a little above shoulder level. Hold the contraction for a second. Tip: make sure that you do not swing the weight or bend at the elbows. Your torso should remain stationary throughout the movement as well.
    As you inhale, slowly lower the plate back down to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can use dumbbells, barbells, cables or exercise bands to perform this movement.

Decline Close-Grip Bench To Skull Crusher muscle diagram

    Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench.
    Using a close grip (a grip that is slightly less than shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked and elbows in. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack.
    Now lower the bar down to your lower chest as you breathe in. Keep the elbows in as you perform this movement.
    Using the triceps to push the bar back up, press it back to the starting position as you exhale.
    As you breathe in and you keep the upper arms stationary, bring the bar down slowly by moving your forearms in a semicircular motion towards you until you feel the bar slightly touch your forehead. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Lift the bar back to the starting position by contracting the triceps and exhaling.
    Repeat steps 3-6 until the recommended amount of repetitions is performed.

Variations: You can use an e-z bar or dumbbells to perform this movement. You can also perform it on a flat bench as well.

    Lying Leg Curls

Lying Leg Curls

The lying leg curl is a popular machine-based exercise for the legs, particularly the hamstrings. It is similar to the seated leg curl, but the open hip angle in the lying leg curl may incorporate more glute and calf activation. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a leg pre-exhaust or as a muscle-building movement for lower-body training.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the hamstrings
    Also works the glutes and calves
    Great accessory movement for a stronger squat and deadlift
    Many lifters say they "feel" this movement more effectively than seated leg curls

Lying Leg Curls Instructions
Lying Leg Curls muscle diagram

    Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie face down on the leg curl machine with the pad of the lever on the back of your legs (just a few inches under the calves). Tip: Preferably use a leg curl machine that is angled as opposed to flat since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment.
    Keeping the torso flat on the bench, ensure your legs are fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances described on the foot positioning section). This will be your starting position.
    As you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.
    As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Do not ever use so much weight on the exercise that you start using swinging and jerking as you can risk both lower back injury and also a hamstring injury.

Variations: Since you have three foot positions you have in reality three exercises. The movement can also be performed with a dumbbell held in between your feet (a partner needs to place it properly). This latter exercise though is only suitable for advanced trainees. Finally, it is also possible to just use one leg at a time for better isolation.

    Cross-body hammer curl

Cross-body hammer curl

The cross-body hammer curl is a dumbbell exercise that targets the biceps, brachialis, and forearm muscles. Rather than lifting the weights directly in front of the body, you lift them across the torso. Throughout each rep, the wrists remain neutral, like a carpenter hammering a nail. This helps isolate the brachialis muscles on each arm. It is generally performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of the arm-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Works not only the biceps but also the brachialis and brachioradialis
    Helps increase biceps and forearm thickness
    Places more emphasis on the biceps long head than the standard hammer curl

    Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand. Your hands should be down at your side with your palms facing in.
    While keeping your palms facing in and without twisting your arm, curl the dumbbell of the right arm up towards your left shoulder as you exhale. Touch the top of the dumbbell to your shoulder and hold the contraction for a second.
    Slowly lower the dumbbell along the same path as you inhale and then repeat the same movement for the left arm.
    Continue alternating in this fashion until the recommended amount of repetitions is performed for each arm.

Variations: You can also perform this exercise in between two pulleys using the end of a rope attachment on each arm.

Benefits

    Allows natural rotation of the hand
    Single-arm rows allow you to really feel the lats working

Ab Roller

The ab wheel roll-out is an exercise targeting the abdominals, often with an inexpensive wheel device with a handle on either side. Many trainers and strength coaches claim it's one of, if no the best exercise for developing strength in the midsection. Beginners may have to start with a limited range of motion or just wheel planks.
Benefits

    Builds and strengthens the abdominals
    Entire core must work during this exercise
    Different stimulus from more traditional moves such as the crunch and reverse crunch
    Can be done with inexpensive equipment at home

Ab Roller Instructions
Ab Roller muscle diagram

    Hold the Ab Roller with both hands and kneel on the floor.
    Now place the ab roller on the floor in front of you so that you are on all your hands and knees (as in a kneeling push up position). This will be your starting position.
    Slowly roll the ab roller straight forward, stretching your body into a straight position. Tip: Go down as far as you can without touching the floor with your body. Breathe in during this portion of the movement.
    After a pause at the stretched position, start pulling yourself back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Go slowly and keep your abs tight at all times.

Caution: This exercise is not advised for people with lower back problems or hernias.

Variations: If you are advanced you can perform the exercise moving the ab roller to the sides in a diagonal fashion as opposed to straight forward. This version places more emphasis on the obliques.

    Safer for the spine than squatting with bad form
    Can accommodate quite a bit of weight without needing a spotter

    Type: Strength

Leg Press Instructions
Leg Press muscle diagram

    Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).
    Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.
    As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.
    Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.

Caution: Always check to make sure that when you re-rack the weight the platform is securely locked.

Variations: All foot stance variations described in the foot stance section.

    Stiff-Legged Dumbbell Deadlift

Stiff-Legged Dumbbell Deadlift

The dumbbell stiff-legged deadlift targets the hamstrings, glutes, low and upper back, as well as the core. The purpose of the stiff-legged, as opposed to Romanian deadlift with slightly bent knees, is to engage the hamstrings and low back to an even greater degree.
Benefits

    Strengthening the glutes and hamstrings will carry over to other forms of the deadlift such as conventional
    Higher reps with lower weight will lend to hypertrophy of the hamstrings and posterior chain
    Also works the calves, quads, and forearms indirectly

    Type: Strength

Stiff-Legged Dumbbell Deadlift Instructions
Stiff-Legged Dumbbell Deadlift muscle diagram

    Grasp a couple of dumbbells holding them by your side at arm's length.
    Stand with your torso straight and your legs spaced using a shoulder width or narrower stance. The knees should be slightly bent. This is your starting position.
    Keeping the knees stationary, lower the dumbbells to over the top of your feet by bending at the waist while keeping your back straight. Keep moving forward as if you were going to pick something from the floor until you feel a stretch on the hamstrings. Exhale as you perform this movement
    Start bringing your torso up straight again by extending your hips and waist until you are back at the starting position. Inhale as you perform this movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is not an exercise that is recommended for people with lower back problems. Also, it needs to be treated with the utmost respect paying special attention not to round the back forward as you move the torso down; the back should always be straight. Finally, jerking motions or doing too much weight can injure your back.

Variations: The exercise can also be performed with a barbell also.

    Chest
    Cable Crossover

Cable Crossover

The cable cross-over is an isolation movement that uses a cable stack to build bigger and stronger pectoral muscles. Since it's done using adjustable pulleys, you can target different parts of your chest by setting the pulleys at different levels. It is common in upper body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, often as a pre-exhaust at the beginning of a workout, or a finishing movement at the end. It is often in combination with other presses or flyes to target the chest from different angles.
Benefits

    Unlike dumbbells, cables provide constant tension, including at peak contraction
    Ability to quickly switch weights for dropsets
    Ability to customize cable height to target specific areas of the chest
    Stretches the chest mucles under load, which can lead to greater muscle gain

    Type: Strength

Cable Crossover Instructions
Cable Crossover muscle diagram

    To get yourself into the starting position, place the pulleys on a high position (above your head), select the resistance to be used and hold the pulleys in each hand.
    Step forward in front of an imaginary straight line between both pulleys while pulling your arms together in front of you. Your torso should have a small forward bend from the waist. This will be your starting position.
    With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, extend your arms to the side (straight out at both sides) in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms and torso should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.
    Return your arms back to the starting position as you breathe out. Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.
    Hold for a second at the starting position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can vary the point in front of you where your arms meet.

    Hold a dumbbell on each hand and lie on an incline bench that is set to an incline angle of no more than 30 degrees.
    Extend your arms above you with a slight bend at the elbows.
    Now rotate the wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing you. Tip: The pinky fingers should be next to each other. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, start to slowly lower the arms to the side while keeping the arms extended and while rotating the wrists until the palms of the hand are facing each other. Tip: At the end of the movement the arms will be by your side with the palms facing the ceiling.
    As you exhale start to bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position by reversing the motion and rotating the hands so that the pinky fingers are next to each other again. Tip: Keep in mind that the movement will only happen at the shoulder joint and at the wrist. There is no motion that happens at the elbow joint.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform regular flyes and also twisting flyes where your initial position starts with the thumbs facing each other instead of the pinky.

    For this exercise you will need access to a low pulley row machine with a V-bar. Note: The V-bar will enable you to have a neutral grip where the palms of your hands face each other. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.
    Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.
    With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise.
    Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Avoid swinging your torso back and forth as you can cause lower back injury by doing so.

Variations:

You can use a straight bar instead of a V-Bar and perform with a pronated grip (palms facing down-forward) or a supinated grip (palms facing up-reverse grip).

Tricep Dumbbell Kickback Instructions
Tricep Dumbbell Kickback muscle diagram

    Start with a dumbbell in each hand and your palms facing your torso. Keep your back straight with a slight bend in the knees and bend forward at the waist. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor. Make sure to keep your head up. Your upper arms should be close to your torso and parallel to the floor. Your forearms should be pointed towards the floor as you hold the weights. There should be a 90-degree angle formed between your forearm and upper arm. This is your starting position.
    Now, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and use your triceps to lift the weights until the arm is fully extended. Focus on moving the forearm.
    After a brief pause at the top contraction, inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can be executed also one arm at a time much like the one arm rows are performed.

Also, if you like the one arm variety, you can use a low pulley handle instead of a dumbbell for better peak contraction. In this case, the palms should be facing up (supinated grip) as opposed to the torso (neutral grip).

Ab bicycle Instructions
Ab bicycle muscle diagram

    Lie flat on the floor with your lower back pressed to the ground. For this exercise, you will need to put your hands beside your head. Be careful however to not strain with the neck as you perform it. Now lift your shoulders into the crunch position.
    Bring knees up to where they are perpendicular to the floor, with your lower legs parallel to the floor. This will be your starting position.
    Now simultaneously, slowly go through a cycle pedal motion kicking forward with the right leg and bringing in the knee of the left leg. Bring your right elbow close to your left knee by crunching to the side, as you breathe out.
    Go back to the initial position as you breathe in.
    Crunch to the opposite side as you cycle your legs and bring closer your left elbow to your right knee and exhale.
    Continue alternating in this manner until all of the recommended repetitions for each side have been completed.

Notes: While you cannot add resistance to this exercise you can concentrate on perfect execution and slow speed.

    Barbell forward lunge

Barbell forward lunge

The barbell forward lunge is a popular lower-body exercise targeting the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. Using a barbell allows you to overload the exercise beyond body weight and perform the movement in strength or muscle-focused rep ranges. The forward lunge can be performed as part of a barbell complex, in a circuit, or on its own in the lower-body portion of any workout.
Benefits

    Serious challenge to all lower-body muscles
    Improves upper-body and core strength through maintaining good posture
    Shorter steps will target quads more, larger steps will target glutes more

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps

Barbell forward lunge Instructions
Barbell forward lunge muscle diagram

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack just below shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.
    Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
    Step away from the rack and step forward with your right leg and squat down through your hips, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: Do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. li>
    Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale.
    Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.

Caution: This is a movement that requires a great deal of balance so if you suffer from balance problems you may wish to either avoid it or just use your own bodyweight while holding on to a fixed object. Definitely never perform with a barbell on your back if you suffer from balance issues.

Variations: There are several ways to perform the exercise.

    One way is to alternate each leg. For instance do one repetition with the right, then the left, then the right and so on.
    The other way is to do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward. In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions. Then you switch legs and do the same.
    A more challenging version is the walking lunges where you walk across the room but in a lunging fashion. For walking lunges the leg being left back has to be brought forward after the lunging action has happened in order to continue moving ahead. This version is reserved for the most advanced athletes.

    3/4 sit-up

3/4 sit-up

The 3/4 sit-up is a bodyweight exercise focused on the muscles of the core. It is similar to a sit-up, but stops short of the top position. This keeps constant tension on the abs, making it more difficult than traditional sit-ups. It can be performed for time or for reps, with the feet anchored or free, as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout.
Benefits

    Activates and strengthens the abs, in particular the rectus abdominis or �six-pack� muscles
    Strengthens the hip flexors in addition to abs
    Simple way to progress sit-ups when they become easy to do for high reps

    Exercise ball leg curl

Exercise ball leg curl

The exercise ball leg curl is an exercise targeting the hamstrings. In particular, it targets the knee flexion function of the hamstrings, as opposed to deadlift variations, which target the other hamstring function, hip flexion. Many lifters opt for this exercise when they don't have access to a lying leg curl machine, but it is worth considering even if you already do machine curls.
Benefits

    Builds muscle and strength in the hamstrings
    Glutes and core also need to work to keep this move stable
    Great substitute for the lying leg curl machine
    Excellent high-rep burnout for leg day

    Begin on the floor laying on your back with your feet on top of the ball.
    Position the ball so that when your legs are extended your ankles are on top of the ball. This will be your starting position.
    Raise your hips off of the ground, keeping your weight on the shoulder blades and your feet.
    Flex the knees, pulling the ball as close to you as you can, contracting the hamstrings.
    After a brief pause, return to the starting position.

    Glute bridge

Glute bridge

The glute bridge is a popular lower-body bodyweight exercise that primarily targets the glutes, but also activates the lower back and hamstrings. It can be performed with body weight alone, or with added resistance such as barbells, dumbbells, or bands. It can be performed for time or reps and works perfectly in a dynamic warm-up for lower-body training, but can also be performed for glute activation anytime.
Benefits

    Great for a warm-up prior to squats or deadlifts
    Can help reduce lower-back pain and strengthen the glutes
    Doesn't require equipment
    Can be made more difficult by manipulating tempo or adding pauses

Close-Grip Front Lat Pulldown Instructions
Close-Grip Front Lat Pulldown muscle diagram

    Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
    Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.
    As you have both arms extended in front of you - while holding the bar at the chosen grip width - bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
    As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary (only the arms should move). The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull the bar down using the forearms.
    After a second in the contracted position, while squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.
    6. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations: The behind-the-neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.

    Triceps
    Dip Machine

Dip Machine

The dip machine is a machine exercise that mimics a triceps dip, a bodyweight exercise performed on parallel bars or on a pull-up and dip station. It targets the triceps first, but also stretches and strengthens the chest and shoulders. Dips with a triceps focus are usually performed with an upright torso, the knees bent and crossed, and the arms close to the body. Dips can be performed for low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle growth.
Benefits

    Builds muscle and strength in the triceps, as well as the chest and shoulders
    Can add extra weight with a dip belt, dumbbell, or chain
    Serious upper-body training with minimal equipment

    Sit securely in a dip machine, select the weight and firmly grasp the handles.
    Now keep your elbows in at your sides in order to place emphasis on the triceps. The elbows should be bent at a 90 degree angle.
    As you contract the triceps, extend your arms downwards as you exhale. Tip: At the bottom of the movement, focus on keeping a little bend in your arms to keep tension on the triceps muscle.
    Now slowly let your arms come back up to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise on parallel bars or on a triceps dip assist machine.

    Dumbbell Lunges

Dumbbell Lunges

The dumbbell split squat is a popular lower-body exercise to build strength and muscle one leg at a time. It can be used to teach proper lunge form, but is also valuable on its own when trained in traditional strength-focused rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps per set, or for higher reps to build muscle or for conditioning.
Benefits

    Builds strength and size in quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    Considered more knee-friendly than lunge variations
    Single-leg stance trains a body position common to many sports

Dumbbell Lunges Instructions
Dumbbell Lunges muscle diagram

    Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides. This will be your starting position.
    Step forward with your right leg around 2 feet or so from the foot being left stationary behind and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground.
    Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale.
    Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.

Caution: This is a movement that requires a great deal of balance so if you suffer from balance problems you may wish to either avoid it or just use your own bodyweight while holding on to a fixed object. Definitely never perform with a barbell on your back if you suffer from balance issues.

Variations: There are several ways to perform the exercise.

One way is to alternate each leg. For instance do one repetition with the right, then the left, then the right and so on.

The other way is to do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward. In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions. Then you switch legs and do the same.

A more challenging version is the walking lunges where you walk across the room but in a lunging fashion. For walking lunges the leg being left back has to be brought forward after the lunging action has happened in order to continue moving ahead. This version is reserved for the most advanced athletes.

Lunges can be performed with dumbbells as described above or with a barbell on the back, though the barbell variety is better suited for the advanced athletes who have mastered the exercise and no longer have balance issues.

    Single-arm standing shoulder press

Single-arm standing shoulder press

The single-arm standing shoulder press is a popular exercise to build size and strength the shoulders and triceps. Most lifters find they can go heavier (per arm) on this movement than if they are pressing two dumbbells simultaneously, making it an effective strength movement as well as a muscle-building movement in higher reps.
Benefits

    Working one shoulder at a time allows for greater focus on working muscle
    Allows a natural rotation of the wrist and elbow as you press
    Standing may allow for a heavier weight and greater muscle stimulus

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Shoulders
    Equipment: Dumbbell
    Level: Intermediate

Single-arm standing shoulder press Instructions
Single-arm standing shoulder press muscle diagram

    Grab a dumbbell and either sit on a military press bench or a utility bench that has a back support on it as you place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs or stand up straight.
    Clean the dumbbell up to bring it to shoulder height. The other hand can be kept fully extended to the side, by the waist or grabbing a fixed surface.
    Rotate the wrist so that the palm of your hand is facing forward. This is your starting position.
    As you exhale, push the dumbbell up until your arm is fully extended.
    After a second pause, slowly come down back to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then switch arms.

Variations: You can perform the exercise standing or sitting on a regular flat bench. For people with lower back problems, the version described is the recommended one.

You can also perform the exercise as Arnold Schwarzenegger used to do it, which is to start holding the dumbbells with a supinated grip (palms facing you) in front of your shoulders and then, as you start pushing up, you align the dumbbells in the starting position described on step 3 by rotating your wrists and touch the dumbbells at the top. As you come down, then you would go back to the starting position by rotating the wrist throughout the lowering portion until the palms of your hands are facing you. This variation is called the Arnold Press. However, it is not recommended if you have rotator cuff problems.

    Preacher Curl

Preacher Curl

The EZ-bar preacher curl is a classic exercise for building bigger biceps. This move is all about isolation. With the back of the upper arms against the pad, it�s next to impossible to cheat. Go light, get a great pump, and build that peak!
Benefits

    Great exercise to isolate the biceps
    Less strain on wrists and elbows than a straight bar
    Eliminates momentum for a stricter movement

    Type: Strength

Preacher Curl Instructions
Preacher Curl muscle diagram

    To perform this movement you will need a preacher bench and an E-Z bar. Grab the E-Z curl bar at the close inner handle (either have someone hand you the bar which is preferable or grab the bar from the front bar rest provided by most preacher benches). The palm of your hands should be facing forward and they should be slightly tilted inwards due to the shape of the bar.
    With the upper arms positioned against the preacher bench pad and the chest against it, hold the E-Z Curl Bar at shoulder length. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, slowly lower the bar until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched.
    As you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps is fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder height. Squeeze the biceps hard and hold this position for a second.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise also using a low pulley with an E-Z Bar attachment instead. In this case you will need to position the bench in front of the pulley. You may also use a wider grip for variety purposes.

    Reverse crunch

Reverse crunch

The reverse crunch is a popular exercise targeting the abdominals, particularly the lower half. It�s easy to perform on either the floor or a flat bench. Many lifters think of this as a companion to the crunch, which targets the upper abdominals more than the lower.
Benefits

    Suitable for beginners
    Great high-rep burnout move for abs
    Targets the lower abdominals

    Type: Strength

    Lie down on the floor with your legs fully extended and arms to the side of your torso with the palms on the floor. Your arms should be stationary for the entire exercise.
    Move your legs up so that your thighs are perpendicular to the floor and feet are together and parallel to the floor. This is the starting position.
    While inhaling, move your legs towards the torso as you roll your pelvis backwards and you raise your hips off the floor. At the end of this movement your knees will be touching your chest.
    Hold the contraction for a second and move your legs back to the starting position while exhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Quadriceps
    Elliptical trainer

Elliptical trainer

The elliptical trainer is a popular machine for cardiovascular training without the significant impact on your joints of running. On many machines, you can adjust the resistance level to make the movement more difficult for all four limbs. The elliptical is a mainstay in most commercial gyms, and can be equally effective for HIIT-style interval workouts or for longer-duration endurance work.
Benefits

    Cardiovascular training with little joint impact
    Most machines allow you to increase the resistance and incline
    Increases stamina and cardiovascular health
    Great tool for achieving fat-loss goals

    Type: Cardio

Elliptical trainer Instructions
Elliptical trainer muscle diagram

    To begin, step onto the elliptical and select the desired option from the menu. Most ellipticals have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.
    The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity.

Ellipticals offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and have far less impact on joints than ground-based cardio such as running. A 150 lb person will burn on average 387 calories in 30 minutes, compared to more than 450-700 calories running. It’s recommended that you use the arms on the elliptical to create more movement, if your elliptical has them.

Bent Over Two-Dumbbell Row With Palms In muscle diagram

    With a dumbbell in each hand (palms facing each other), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The weights should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.
    While keeping the torso stationary, lift the dumbbells to your side as you breathe out, squeezing your shoulder blades together. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.
    Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution:

    This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.
    Ensure perfect form and never round the back as this can cause back injury.
    Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a low pulley instead with a V-bar or with a barbell.

    Hex-bar deadlift

Hex-bar deadlift

The hex bar deadlift is a variety of deadlift performed in a hexagonal barbell also known as a trap bar. The bar is held with a parallel (palms in) grip outside of the legs. It is biomechanically different from a barbell deadlift in that it lines up with a lifter's center of gravity, rather than placing the weight in front of their body. It activates all of the same muscle groups as conventional or sumo deadlifts, including the glutes, quads, hamstrings, lower back, lats, upper back, and grip.
Benefits

    Many people find it more back-friendly than a barbell deadlift
    Can be performed in more of a squat or deadlift style, according to comfort and anatomy
    Can safely be done for higher reps than barbell deadlifts

Narrow-stance leg press

The narrow-stance leg press is a machine-based exercise that targets the muscles of the legs. It emphasizes the quads, particularly the muscles of the outer quads and hips. It is often used as an accessory for squats, or as a muscle-building movement during lower-body training when it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the quads, but also works the glutes and hamstrings
    Great quad burnout on leg day
    Simple to alter tempo or add pauses to increase difficulty

Narrow-stance leg press Instructions
Narrow-stance leg press muscle diagram

    Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Your feet should be around 3 inches or less apart. Tip: Keep your head up at all times and also maintain the back on the pad at all times.
    Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.
    As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.
    Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.

Caution: Always check to make sure that when you re-rack the weight the platform is securely locked.

Variations: All foot stance variations described in the foot stance section.

    Place the back of your torso against the back pad of the machine and hook your shoulders under the shoulder pads provided.
    Position your legs in the platform using a less than shoulder width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Your feet should be around 3 inches or less apart. Tip: Keep your head up at all times and also maintain the back on the pad at all times.
    Place your arms on the side handles of the machine and disengage the safety bars (which on most designs is done by moving the side handles from a facing front position to a diagonal position).
    Now straighten your legs without locking the knees. This will be your starting position.
    Begin to slowly lower the unit by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up (back on the pad at all times). Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Begin to raise the unit as you exhale by pushing the floor with mainly with the heels of your feet as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Seated Close-Grip Concentration Barbell Curl Instructions
Seated Close-Grip Concentration Barbell Curl muscle diagram

    Sit down on a flat bench with a barbell or E-Z Bar in front of you in between your legs. Your legs should be spread with the knees bent and the feet on the floor.
    Use your arms to pick the barbell up and place the back of your upper arms on top of your inner thighs (around three and a half inches away from the front of the knee). A supinated grip closer than shoulder width is needed to perform this exercise. Tip: Your arm should be extended at arms length and the barbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
    Slowly begin to bring the barbell back to starting position as your breathe in. Tip: Avoid swinging motions at any time.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can be performed standing with the torso bent forward and the arm in front of you. In this case, no leg support is used for the back of your arm so you will need to make extra effort to ensure no movement of the upper arms. This is a more challenging version of the exercise and is not recommended for people with lower back issues. You can also perform as described here but without using a bench. So for this version you will be kneeling and the weight of the barbell will help to balance you.

    Lie on a flat bench face down with one arm holding a dumbbell and the other hand on top of the bench folded so that you can rest your head on it.
    Bend the elbows of the arm holding the dumbbell so that it creates a 90-degree angle between the upper arm and the forearm.
    Now raise the upper arm so that the forearm is perpendicular to the floor and the upper arm is perpendicular to your torso. Tip: The upper arm should be parallel to the floor and also creating a 90-degree angle with your torso. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe out, externally rotate your forearm so that the dumbbell is lifted forward as you maintain the 90 degree angle bend between the upper arms and the forearm. You will continue this external rotation until the forearm is parallel to the floor. At this point you will hold the contraction for a second.
    As you breathe in, slowly go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: There is no need to go heavy with this exercise. Too much weight will cause rotator cuff injury.

Variations: This exercise can be performed standing.

Smith machine box squat

The Smith machine box squat is a machine-based exercise targeting the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. The Smith machine mimics a barbell but provides more stability. This movement can be programmed in low reps for strength or power or higher reps for muscle and strength endurance. It is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a full-body or lower-body workout.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    Can squat heavy weight without risk of getting pinned beneath the bar
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to get into position and control

    Type: Strength

    To begin, first set the bar to a position that best matches your height. Once the bar is loaded, step under it and position it across the back of your shoulders.
    Take the bar with your hands facing forward, unlock it and lift it off the rack by extending your legs.
    Move your feet forward about 18 inches in front of the bar. Position your legs using a shoulder width stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Look forward at all times and maintain a neutral or slightly arched spine. This will be your starting position.
    Slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper and lower leg breaks 90 degrees.
    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heels of your feet, extending the knees and returning to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Upside-down pull-up

Upside-down pull-up

The upside-down pull-up is an advanced bodyweight exercise that is normally performed on a pair of gymnastic rings. It involves pulling the body toward the ceiling in an inverted position. It targets the same muscles as traditional pull-ups, including the lats (latissimus dorsi), biceps, and core. However, the pulling angle is more akin to a bent-over row or upright row, depending on the angle of your hips.
Benefits

    Strengthens the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), biceps, upper back, core, and grip
    Can be performed with hips bent to target the back more, or the body straight to target the rear shoulders and traps
    Serious core work

    Begin by taking a medium to wide grip on a pull-up apparatus with your palms facing away from you. From a hanging position, tuck your knees to your chest, leaning back and getting your legs over your side of the pull-up apparatus. This will be your starting position.
    Beginning with your arms straight, flex the elbows and retract the shoulder blades to raise your body up until your legs contact the pull-up apparatus.
    After a brief pause, return to the starting position.

Reverse Barbell Preacher Curls

The reverse-grip barbell curl is a variation on the biceps curl where the palms face downward. The switch from an underhand to an overhand grip brings the forearm and brachialis muscles more into the exercise. If it is uncomfortable to the wrists, try performing it on the angles of an EZ-curl bar.
Benefits

    Builds forearms more than underhand curl variations
    Builds biceps thickness and brachialis size
    Great high-rep finishing move for arms day

    Grab an EZ-bar using a shoulder width and palms down (pronated) grip.
    Now place the upper part of both arms on top of the preacher bench and have your arms extended. This will be your starting position.
    As you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps are fully contracted and the barbell is at shoulder height. Squeeze the biceps hard for a second at the contracted position.
    As you breathe in, slowly lower the barbell until your upper arms are extended and the biceps is fully stretched.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can be performed using an e-z bar, cables or dumbbells.

    Using a narrow grip lift the bar and hold it straight over your torso with your elbows in. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position.
    Now lower the bar down to your lower chest as you breathe in. Keep the elbows in as you perform this movement.
    Using the triceps to push the bar back up, press it back to the starting position by extending the elbows as you exhale.
    Repeat.

Hyperextensions With No Hyperextension Bench Instructions
Hyperextensions With No Hyperextension Bench muscle diagram

    With someone holding down your legs, slide yourself down to the edge a flat bench until your hips hang off the end of the bench. Tip: Your entire upper body should be hanging down towards the floor. Also, you will be in the same position as if you were on a hyperextension bench but the range of motion will be shorter due to the height of the flat bench vs. that of the hyperextension bench.
    With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms.
    Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you almost touch the floor or you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings (whichever comes first). Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise.
    Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you exhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a hyperextension bench. Also, a similar exercise to this one is the good morning and the stiff-legged deadlift.

    Pick a couple of dumbbells and stand with a straight torso and the dumbbells on front of your thighs at arms length with the palms of the hand facing your thighs. This will be your starting position.
    While maintaining the torso stationary (no swinging), lift the dumbbells to the front with a slight bend on the elbow and the palms of the hands always facing down. Continue to go up until you arms are slightly above parallel to the floor. Exhale as you execute this portion of the movement and pause for a second at the top.
    As you inhale, lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed by alternating hands, meaning doing one repetition with the right arm, and then one with the left, back to the right, etc. Also, you could use a barbell as well.

    Parallel Bar Dip

Parallel Bar Dip

The triceps dip is a bodyweight exercise performed on parallel bars or on a pull-up and dip station. It targets the triceps first, but also stretches and strengthens the chest and shoulders.

Dips can be performed for low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle growth.
Benefits

    Builds muscle and strength in the triceps, as well as the chest and shoulders
    Can add extra weight with a dip belt, dumbbell, or chain
    Serious upper-body training with minimal equipment

    Reverse the motion by extending the elbow, pushing yourself back up into the starting position.
    Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

    Quadriceps
    Stairmaster

Stairmaster

The stair climber is a popular cardio machine found in most commercial gyms. Along with burning a ton of calories, the stair climber also helps build strength in the lower body, especially the glutes. It can work well at higher speeds for interval-style conditioning training, but also works well at slower paces for steady-state cardio.
Benefits

    Burns a lot of calories
    Easier on the joints than running
    Great for sculpting the legs and glutes

    Type: Cardio
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps

Stairmaster Instructions
Stairmaster muscle diagram

    To begin, step onto the stairmaster and select the desired option from the menu. You can choose a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise.
    Pump your legs up and down in an established rhythm, driving the pedals down but not all the way to the floor. It is recommended that you maintain your grip on the handles so that you don’t fall. The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity.
    Stairmasters offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside. They are typically much harder than other cardio equipment. A 150 lb person will typically burn over 300 calories in 30 minutes, compared to about 175 calories walking.

    Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium-width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over your neck with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your neck.
    After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up).
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.

Caution:

    It is imperative that if you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.
    For obvious reasons you need to be in full control of the barbell at all times.

    V-bar pull-up

V-bar pull-up

The V-bar pull-up is a bodyweight exercise utilizing a double-D or V-bar handle placed on top of a straight bar. This set-up approximates a close-grip neutral-grip pull-up, in which the reps are performed with the palms facing one another. Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core. It can be used as a more shoulder-friendly alternative to straight-bar pull-ups, or to help perform more reps than you can perform overhand.
Benefits

    Strengthens the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), biceps, upper back, core, and grip
    Can build absolute strength for low reps, or strength endurance for higher reps
    Many people find them slightly easier than straight-bar pull-ups
    Many people find the neutral grip feels better on the shoulders than straight-bar pull-ups

V-bar pull-up muscle diagram

    Start by placing the middle of the V-bar in the middle of the pull-up bar (assuming that the pull-up station you are using does not have neutral grip handles). The V-Bar handles will be facing down so that you can hang from the pull-up bar through the use of the handles.
    Once you securely place the V-bar, take a hold of the bar from each side and hang from it. Stick your chest out and lean yourself back slightly in order to better engage the lats. This will be your starting position.
    Using your lats, pull your torso up while leaning your head back slightly so that you do not hit yourself with the chin-up bar. Continue until your chest nearly touches the V-bar. Exhale as you execute this motion.
    After a second hold on the contracted position, slowly lower your body back to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.

Variations:

    If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a pull-up assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.
    Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.

On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.

    Triceps
    Ring dip

Ring dip

The ring dip is an upper-body strength exercise performed on gymnastic rings. It targets the muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders, but is also quite taxing to the core. It is generally considered to be more difficult than dips performed on parallel bars. It is common in gymnastics training and CrossFit workouts, but is also a simple way to make dips more challenging for any strength athlete.
Benefits

    Stretches and strengthens the pectoral, deltoid, and triceps muscles
    Intense stabilization challenge for shoulders and core
    Easy to regress by setting rings closer to the ground
    Can be performed with hollow-body position or knees bent

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Triceps
    Equipment: Body Only

    Grip a ring in each hand, and then take a small jump to help you get into the starting position with your arms locked out.
    Begin by flexing the elbow, lowering your body until your arms break 90 degrees. Avoid swinging, and maintain good posture throughout the descent.
    Reverse the motion by extending the elbow, pushing yourself back up into the starting position.
    Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

Benefits

    Builds stronger and more muscular biceps
    Limits the amount of momentum that can be used (i.e., cheating)
    Great for building the biceps peak

    Type: Strength

Standing One-Arm Cable Curl Instructions
Standing One-Arm Cable Curl muscle diagram

    Start out by grabbing single handle next to the low pulley machine. Make sure you are far enough from the machine so that your arm is supporting the weight.
    Make sure that your upper arm is stationary, perpendicular to the floor with elbows in and palms facing forward. Your non lifting arm should be grabbing your waist. This will allow you to keep your balance.
    Slowly begin to curl the single handle upwards while keeping the upper arm stationary until your forearm touches your bicep while exhaling. Tip: Only the forearm should move.
    Hold the contraction position as you squeeze the bicep and then lower the single handle back down to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms while performing this exercise.

Double-arm triceps kick-back

The double-arm triceps kick-back is a popular movement to increase size and strength of the triceps. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.
Benefits

    Builds triceps size and definition
    Emphasis on lateral head of triceps
    Great high-rep burnout with light weight

Double-arm triceps kick-back Instructions
Double-arm triceps kick-back muscle diagram

    With a dumbbell in each hand and the palms facing your torso, bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Make sure that you keep the head up. The upper arms should be close to the torso and parallel to the floor while the forearms are pointing towards the floor as the hands hold the weights. Tip: There should be a 90-degree angle between the forearms and the upper arm. This is your starting position.
    Keeping the upper arms stationary, use the triceps to lift the weights as you exhale until the forearms are parallel to the floor and the whole arms are extended. Like many other arm exercises, only the forearm moves.
    After a second contraction at the top, slowly lower the dumbbells back to their starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can be executed also one arm at a time.
    Also, if you like the one arm variety, you can use a single hand handle or rope attachment instead of a dumbbell for better peak contraction. In this case of the single hand handle, the palms should be facing up as opposed to the torso.

    Quadriceps
    Dumbbell reverse lunge

Dumbbell reverse lunge

The dumbbell reverse lunge is a popular lower-body movement that targets the muscles of the quads, glutes, hamstrings, and hips. It also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Lunge variations are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per leg or more, as part of the lower-body portion of a workout. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing split squats instead.
Benefits

    Many people find them more knee-friendly than walking or forward lunges
    Simple way to overload the lunge movement pattern
    Helps improve hip flexibility and core stability

    Type: Strength

Dumbbell reverse lunge Instructions
Dumbbell reverse lunge muscle diagram

    Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides. This will be your starting position.
    Step backward with your right leg around two feet or so from the left foot and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Tip: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground. Keep the torso upright during the lunge; flexible hip flexors are important. A long lunge emphasizes the Gluteus Maximus; a short lunge emphasizes Quadriceps.
    Push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale. Tip: Use the ball of your feet to push in order to accentuate the quadriceps. To focus on the glutes, press with your heels.
    Now repeat with the opposite leg.

Variations: There are several ways to perform the exercise. You can do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward. In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions. Then you switch legs and do the same. A more challenging version is the walking lunges where you walk across the room but in a lunging fashion. For walking lunges the leg being left back has to be brought forward after the lunging action has happened in order to continue moving ahead. This version is reserved for the most advanced athletes.

Lunges can be performed with dumbbells as described above or with a barbell on the back, though the barbell variety is better suited for the advanced athletes who have mastered the exercise and no longer have balance issues.

    Place your lower thighs under the lever pad, which will need to be adjusted according to the height of your thighs. Now place your hands on top of the lever pad in order to prevent it from slipping forward.
    Lift the lever slightly by pushing your heels up and release the safety bar. This will be your starting position.
    Slowly lower your heels by bending at the ankles until the calves are fully stretched. Inhale as you perform this movement.
    Raise the heels by extending the ankles as high as possible as you contract the calves and breathe out. Hold the top contraction for a second.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Calf Press On The Leg Press Machine muscle diagram

    Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance.
    Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you without locking your knees. (Note: In some leg press units you can leave the safety bars on for increased safety. If your leg press unit allows for this, then this is the preferred method of performing the exercise.) Your torso and the legs should make perfect 90-degree angle. Now carefully place your toes and balls of your feet on the lower portion of the platform with the heels extending off. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position.
    Press on the platform by raising your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
    Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Be very cautious as you place the feet in the bottom part of the platform as if you slip and the safety bars are not locked then you could suffer a serious accident.

Variations: You can perform this exercise one leg at a time.

Barbell step-up

The barbell step-up is a great exercise for building lower-body strength and power. It targets all the same muscles as bodyweight step-ups, such as the quads, glutes, and hamstrings, but allows for greater muscular overload.

Barbell step-up Instructions
Barbell step-up muscle diagram

    Stand up straight while holding a barbell placed on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) and stand upright behind an elevated platform (such as the one used for spotting behind a flat bench). This is your starting position.
    Place the right foot on the elevated platform. Step on the platform by extending the hip and the knee of your right leg. Use the heel mainly to lift the rest of your body up and place the foot of the left leg on the platform as well. Breathe out as you execute the force required to come up.
    Step down with the left leg by flexing the hip and knee of the right leg as you inhale. Return to the original standing position by placing the right foot of to next to the left foot on the initial position.
    Repeat with the right leg for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.

Note: This is a great exercise for people with lower back problems that are unable to do stiff legged deadlifts.

Variations: Just like lunges, this exercise can also be performed by alternating between the right and the left leg every time until all repetitions have been performed for both legs. Also, dumbbells can be used. Beginners can start with only the bodyweight, especially if they have balance issues.

    Feet-elevated bench dip

Feet-elevated bench dip

The feet-elevated bench dip is a popular bodyweight exercise for building the triceps, chest, and shoulders. Elevating the feet brings more chest and shoulder into the movement, but also allows for extra weight on the hips. If these bother your shoulders, try performing them between two benches or chairs rather than on a single bench.
Benefits

    Builds stronger, more muscular triceps and chest
    Great for burnout sets at the end of an arm workout
    Can be performed using chairs or any other elevated surface
    Extra weight can be added without a dip belt

    Type: Strength

Feet-elevated bench dip Instructions
Feet-elevated bench dip muscle diagram

    For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back. With the bench perpendicular to your body, and while looking away from it, hold on to the bench on its edge with the hands fully extended, separated at shoulder width. The legs will be extended forward, bent at the waist and perpendicular to your torso. This will be your starting position.
    Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down.
    Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can place your legs on top of another flat bench in front of you in order to make the exercise more challenging. If that variation also becomes easy, then you can have a partner place plates on top of your lap. Make sure that in this case the partner ensures that the weights stay there throughout the movement.

    Bent Over Barbell Row

Bent Over Barbell Row

The barbell bent-over row is a compound exercise used to build strength and size in both the lower and upper back. It targets nearly all of the muscles in the back, but particularly the lats, rhomboids, and lower back. It is commonly utilized as an accessory movement for the deadlift in powerlifting, but is also popular in strength and muscle-focused upper-body workouts.
Benefits

    Builds both back size and strength
    Strengthens the lats, rhomboids, spinal erectors, hamstrings, and glutes
    Teaches proper ab bracing and spinal position
    Can be loaded more heavily than other row variations

Bent Over Barbell Row Instructions
Bent Over Barbell Row muscle diagram

    Holding a barbell with a pronated grip (palms facing down), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The barbell should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.
    Now, while keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause.
    Then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.

Also, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.

Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a supinated (palms facing you) grip.

    Crunches

Crunches

The crunch is a popular core exercise targeting the rectus abdominis, or "six-pack" muscles, as well as the obliques. It has been the centerpiece of many ab-focused workouts, due to both its simplicity and the intense burn and mind-muscle connection it produces. It can be performed for time or reps as part of the ab-focused portion of any workout.
Benefits

    Strengthens the abdominal muscles
    Can be performed with feet anchored or unanchored
    Can be performed by all fitness levels

Crunches Instructions
Crunches muscle diagram

    Lie flat on your back with your feet flat on the ground, or resting on a bench with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. If you are resting your feet on a bench, place them three to four inches apart and point your toes inward so they touch.
    Now place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Don't lock your fingers behind your head.
    While pushing the small of your back down in the floor to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off the floor.
    Continue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the floor only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the floor. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using momentum.
    After the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: There are many variations for the crunch. You can perform the exercise with weights, or on top of an exercise ball or on a decline bench.

Dumbbell Alternate Bicep Curl Instructions
Dumbbell Alternate Bicep Curl muscle diagram

    Stand (torso upright) with a dumbbell in each hand held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso and the palms of your hand should be facing your thighs.
    While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the right weight as you rotate the palm of the hands until they are facing forward. At this point continue contracting the biceps as you breathe out until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Tip: Only the forearms should move.
    Slowly begin to bring the dumbbell back to the starting position as your breathe in. Tip: Remember to twist the palms back to the starting position (facing your thighs) as you come down.
    Repeat the movement with the left hand. This equals one repetition.
    Continue alternating in this manner for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it using both arms at the same time. Additionally, you may perform it with a starting position in which both palms are facing forward. In this case, you may alternate the arms as well, or perform at the same time.
    You can also do the exercise starting with both palms of the hands facing the torso and then rotating forward as the movement is performed. At the top of the movement the palms should face forward and the small finger should be higher than the thumb for a peak contraction.

Just like the Dumbbell Biceps Curl except you alternate each hand, curling one dumbbell at a time.

    Bent-over dumbbell rear delt row

Bent-over dumbbell rear delt row

The bent-over dumbbell rear delt row is a popular upper-body exercise that targets the muscles on the backside of the shoulder joint, specifically the medial and rear heads of the deltoid. Since pressing movements build the front and (to a lesser degree) side deltoid heads, this move is often done to promote balanced shoulder development. It is usually performed for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more, as part of a shoulder or upper-body workout.
Benefits

    Promotes aesthetically and functionally balanced shoulders
    Can use heavier weights than rear delt flies
    Recruits postural and stabilizer muscles important for shoulder stability

    Type: Strength

    Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand. With the knees slightly bent, flex at the hip to lean forward. Ensure that your back is straight and stays that way for the duration of the exercise. Allow your arms to hang perpendicular to the floor, with the wrists pronated and the elbows pointed to your sides. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by flexing the elbows and transversely extending the shoulder, rowing the dumbbells toward your torso. Your shoulders should stay retracted, squeezing your scapulae together throughout the movement. The upper arms should be perpendicular to your torso.
    Continue the row until the elbows are inside of 90 degrees, contracting your shoulders as you pause at the top.
    Return to the starting position, taking care to maintain both shoulder and spinal positioning. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

    Adjust the cable to the same height as your elbow. Stand with your left side to the band a couple of feet away.
    Grasp the handle with your right hand, and keep your elbow pressed firmly to your side. We recommend you hold a pad or foam roll in place with your elbow to keep it firmly in position.
    With your upper arm in position, your elbow should be flexed to 90 degrees with your hand reaching across the front of your torso. This will be your starting position.
    Execute the movement by rotating your arm in a backhand motion, keeping your elbow in place. Continue as far as you are able, pause, and then return to the starting position.

Handstand push-up

The handstand push-up is an exercise targeting the shoulders, although other muscles assist in the completion of the reps. It is common in both CrossFit workouts and advanced bodyweight or calisthenics training. Given the degree of difficulty, beginners will need to progress to this move.
Benefits

    Builds and strengthens the shoulders
    The core works hard to maintain stability during the up-and-down movement
    If full ROM is too difficult at first, you can reduce it by placing a pad under your head

    With your back to the wall bend at the waist and place both hands on the floor at shoulder width.
    Kick yourself up against the wall with your arms straight. Your body should be upside down with the arms and legs fully extended. Keep your whole body as straight as possible. Tip: If doing this for the first time, have a spotter help you. Also, make sure that you keep facing the wall with your head, rather than looking down.
    Slowly lower yourself to the ground as you inhale until your head almost touches the floor. Tip: It is of utmost importance that you come down slow in order to avoid head injury.
    Push yourself back up slowly as you exhale until your elbows are nearly locked.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Ensure that the floor surface is not slippery and also, if performing for the first time, use a spotter until you get good at this exercise.

Single-arm dumbbell preacher curl

The single-arm dumbbell preacher curl is an exercise that focuses on building the biceps, particularly the biceps peak. Most people will go light on this movement, performing it for moderate to high reps as part of an upper-body or arms-focused workout.
Benefits

    Builds the biceps peak
    The preacher bench enforces strict form, making the biceps work harder
    When you train one arm at a time, one side can't compensate for the other

Single-arm dumbbell preacher curl Instructions
Single-arm dumbbell preacher curl muscle diagram

    Grab a dumbbell with the right arm and place the upper arm on top of the preacher bench or the incline bench. The dumbbell should be held at shoulder length. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, slowly lower the dumbbell until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched.
    As you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder height. Again, remember that to ensure full contraction you need to bring that small finger higher than the thumb.
    Squeeze the biceps hard for a second at the contracted position and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the movement.

Variations: You can perform this exercise using a low pulley instead of a dumbbell. In this case you will need to position the bench in front of the pulley.

    Step-up with knee raise

Step-up with knee raise

The step-up with knee raise is a lower-body exercise targeting the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. It differs from a traditional step-up in that at the top, you lift the trailing leg up to full hip flexion. This gives the exercise a greater range of motion and more of a focus on powerful hip extension in the working leg. When performed with body weight, these are usually performed for high reps as part of a dynamic warm-up, as cardio acceleration, or as part of the lower-body portion of a workout or circuit.
Benefits

    Builds hip and leg strength
    Helps with muscle and strength imbalances
    Can be progressed from body weight to resistance with dumbbells or a barbell

    Type: Strength

Step-up with knee raise muscle diagram

    Stand facing a box or bench of an appropriate height with your feet together. This will be your starting position.
    Begin the movement by stepping up, putting your left foot on the top of the bench. Extend through the hip and knee of your front leg to stand up on the box. As you stand on the box with your left leg, flex your right knee and hip, bringing your knee as high as you can.
    Reverse this motion to step down off the box, and then repeat the sequence on the opposite leg.

    Smith machine back squat

Smith machine back squat

The Smith machine back squat is a machine-based exercise targeting the muscles of the lower body. The Smith machine mimics a barbell but provides more stability. This movement can be programmed in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle and strength endurance. It is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a full-body or lower-body workout.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    Works the core and upper back to maintain an upright posture
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to get into position and control

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps

    To begin, first set the bar on the height that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.
    Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side (palms facing forward), unlock it and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
    Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).
    Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with leg presses instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.

Variations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.

You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.

Same as the Barbell Squat but with a Smith Machine.

    Incline dumbbell front raise

Incline dumbbell front raise

The incline dumbbell front raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the shoulders. Because it is performed face down on an angled bench, it has a greater range of motion than standing or upright-seated raises and hits the shoulders from a different angle. Raise variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or shoulder-focused training.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the anterior and medial deltoids
    Performing on a bench enforces strict form and eliminates momentum
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day

    Type: Strength

    Sit down on an incline bench with the incline set anywhere between 30 to 60 degrees while holding a dumbbell on each hand. Tip: You can change the angle to hit the muscle a little differently each time.
    Extend your arms straight in front of you and have your palms facing down with the dumbbells raised about 1 inch above your thighs. This will be your starting position.
    Slowly raise the dumbbells straight up until they are slightly above your shoulders, while keeping your elbows locked. Squeeze at the top for a second and make sure you breathe out during this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep your head resting down against the bench and your legs on the floor at all times.
    Lower the arms back to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can use a barbell as well for this exercise.

    Alternate Incline Dumbbell Curl

Alternate Incline Dumbbell Curl

The alternating incline dumbbell biceps curl is an exercise targeting the biceps and performed face up on an incline bench. This creates a vertical arm angle which helps to isolate the biceps and limit involvement of the shoulder muscles. This curl variation is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 rep per arm or more, as part of upper-body or arm-focused training.
Benefits

    Greater time under tension than double curls
    Adds size and definition to the biceps
    Positioning on the incline bench helps isolate the biceps and enforce strict form
    Great burnout movement on arm day

    Sit down on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand being held at arms length. Tip: Keep the elbows close to the torso.This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the right weight forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. As you do so, rotate the hand so that the palm is facing up. Continue the movement until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Tip: Only the forearms should move.
    Slowly begin to bring the dumbbell back to starting position as your breathe in.
    Repeat the movement with the left hand. This equals one repetition.
    Continue alternating in this manner for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Just like the Incline Dumbbell Curl but only one arm at a time.

    Standing dumbbell upright row

Standing dumbbell upright row

The standing dumbbell upright row is a popular movement for building stronger and bigger traps and shoulders. Many lifters combine this move with either their back or shoulder workout, since it involves both body parts. It is generally performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Builds stronger, bigger traps and lateral deltoids
    More shoulder-friendly than barbell upright rows
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day

Standing dumbbell upright row Instructions
Standing dumbbell upright row muscle diagram

    Grasp a dumbbell in each hand with a pronated (palms forward) grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The dumbbells should be resting on top of your thighs. Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your back should be straight. This will be your starting position.
    Use your side shoulders to lift the dumbbells as you exhale. The dumbbells should be close to the body as you move it up and the elbows should drive the motion. Continue to lift them until they nearly touch your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbells, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.
    Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using an e-z bar.

    Single-arm cable front raise

Single-arm cable front raise

The single-arm cable front raise is an isolation exercise targeting the anterior and medial deltoids or shoulder muscles. The single-arm version of this movement allows you to focus on each side independently. Because grip will be a limitation, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.
Benefits

    Strengthens and develops the anterior deltoids
    Using a cable makes it harder to use momentum
    The cable keeps constant tension on the muscles

    Select the weight on a low pulley machine and grasp the single hand cable attachment that is attached to the low pulley with your left hand.
    Face away from the pulley and put your arm straight down with the hand cable attachment in front of your thighs at arms' length with the palms of the hand facing your thighs. This will be your starting position.
    While maintaining the torso stationary (no swinging), lift the left arm to the front with a slight bend on the elbow and the palms of the hand always faces down. Continue to go up until you arm is slightly above parallel to the floor. Exhale as you execute this portion of the movement and pause for a second at the top.
    Now as you inhale lower the arm back down slowly to the starting position.
    Once all of the recommended amount of repetitions have been performed for this arm, switch arms and perform the exercise with the right one.

Variations: This exercise can be performed also with dumbbells or an exercise band.

    Incline cable chest press

Incline cable chest press

The incline cable chest press is a pressing movement that uses a cable stack and an incline bench to target the upper portion of the pectoral muscles, similar to an incline dumbbell press. It is common in upper-body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, where it can be effective as a primary movement in classic hypertrophy rep ranges, as a pre-exhaust, or as a high-rep finisher. It is often used in combination with other presses or flyes to target the chest from different angles.
Benefits

    Unlike dumbbells, cables provide constant tension, including at peak contraction
    Can quickly switch weights for dropsets
    The line of resistance from the cables targets the muscles of the upper pectorals
    Stretches the chest muscles under load which can lead to greater muscle gain

    Adjust the weight to an appropriate amount and be seated, grasping the handles. Your upper arms should be about 45 degrees to the body, with your head and chest up. The elbows should be bent to about 90 degrees. This will be your starting position.
    Begin by extending through the elbow, pressing the handles together straight in front of you. Keep your shoulder blades retracted as you execute the movement.
    After pausing at full extension, return to the starting position, keeping tension on the cables.

    Grab the rope with both hands above your head. Pull down on the rope as you take a small jump.
    Wrap the rope around one leg, using your feet to pinch the rope. Reach up as high as possible with your arms, gripping the rope tightly.
    Release the rope from your feet as you pull yourself up with your arms, bringing your knees towards your chest.
    Resecure your feet on the rope, and then stand up to take another high hold on the rope. Continue until you reach the top of the rope.
    To lower yourself, loosen the grip of your feet on the rope as you slide down using a hand over hand motion.

Trail Running/Walking Instructions
Trail Running/Walking muscle diagram

    Running or hiking on trails will get the blood pumping and heart beating almost immediately. Make sure you have good shoes. While you use the muscles in your calves and buttocks to pull yourself up a hill, the knees, joints and ankles absorb the bulk of the pounding coming back down. Take smaller steps as you walk downhill, keep your knees bent to reduce the impact and slow down to avoid falling.
    A 150 lb person can burn over 200 calories for 30 minutes walking uphill, compared to 175 on a flat surface. If running the trail, a 150 lb person can burn well over 500 calories in 30 minutes.

    Standing Bradford press

Standing Bradford press

The standing Bradford press is an obscure yet effective shoulder exercise that alternates front presses with behind-the-neck presses. It can be used as a warm-up for other press variations on a shoulder day, or as a muscle-building movement on its own in a shoulder or upper-body focused workout. It is usually performed for relatively high reps, such as 8-15 reps per set or higher, or just to the point of fatigue.
Benefits

    Increases shoulder mobility
    Works multiple heads of the deltoids at once
    Great warm-up or burnout

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Shoulders
    Equipment: Barbell

Standing Bradford press Instructions

    Place a loaded bar at shoulder level in a rack. With a pronated grip at shoulder width, begin with the bar racked across the front of your shoulders. This is your starting position.
    Initiate the lift by extending the elbows to press the bar overhead. Avoid locking out the elbow as you move the weight behind your head.
    Lower the bar down to the back of the head until your elbow forms a right angle.
    Lift the bar back over your head by extending the elbows
    Lower the bar down to the starting position.
    Alternate in this manner until you complete the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Neutral-grip dumbbell bench press

Neutral-grip dumbbell bench press

The neutral-grip dumbbell bench press is a variation on a classic chest-building exercise where the palms face each other instead of forward. This shift puts the elbows closer to the sides, placing more emphasis on the triceps, and perhaps also the inner chest. The neutral-grip press can be performed in lower reps for strength or higher reps for muscle growth.
Benefits

    Increased triceps focus over normal grip
    Also works the chest and shoulders
    Many people find it more shoulder-friendly than the close-grip barbell bench press

    Take a dumbbell in each hand and lay back onto a flat bench. Your feet should be flat on the floor and your shoulder blades retracted.
    Maintaining a neutral grip, palms facing each other, begin with your arms extended directly above you, perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position.
    Begin the movement by flexing the elbow, lowering the upper arms to the side. Descend until the dumbbells are to your torso.
    Pause, then extend the elbow and return to the starting position.

Wide-Grip Rear Pull-Up muscle diagram

    Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using a wide grip.
    As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar, bring your torso forward and head so that there is an imaginary line from the pull-up bar to the back of your neck. This is your starting position.
    Pull your torso up until the bar is near the back of your neck. To do this, draw the shoulders and upper arms down and back while slightly leaning your head forward. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
    After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.
    Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Caution: The behind the neck variation can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck. Therefore if you have rotator cuff issues, use the pull-up to front version instead.

Variations:

    If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.
    Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.

This is like a normal wide-grip pull-up but you finish with the bar behind your neck instead of in front.

    Kettlebell pass-through lunge

Kettlebell pass-through lunge

The kettlebell pass-through lunge is a dynamic leg and core exercise in which a lifter passes a weight under their front leg during lunges. It is a unique coordination challenge, but also challenging to the musculature of the abdomen, lower body, shoulders, and upper back. It is most commonly performed for higher reps, such as 10-15 reps per side, or for time. It can work in circuit-style workouts, or in lower-body or full-body time-efficient training.
Benefits

    Forces the core to stabilize while the limbs move
    Trains strength in the legs, hamstrings, and glutes one side at a time
    Significant cardiovascular challenge and calorie burn
    Excellent full-body coordination exercise

    Hands-elevated push-up

Hands-elevated push-up

The hands-elevated push-up is a variation on the classic push-up where the hands are placed on a bench or other elevated surface. Having the hands higher than the feet makes it easier than push-ups on the floor, but also puts the emphasis more on the triceps. It can be used as a substitute for floor push-ups or as a mechanical dropset after maxing out on floor push-ups.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the triceps and chest muscles
    Effective substitution for push-ups in any workout
    Great for burn-out sets at the end of a chest or triceps workout

Deadlift with Bands Instructions
Deadlift with Bands muscle diagram

    To deadlift with short bands, simply loop them over the bar before you start, and step into them to set up. For long bands, they will need to be anchored to a secure base, such as heavy dumbbells or a rack. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Ensure that the bands are under the back half of your foot (for short bands), directly where you are driving into the floor. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets.2. With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.
    Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.

    Straight-arm rope pull-down

Straight-arm rope pull-down

The straight-arm rope pull-down is a variation of the straight-arm lat pull-down performed using a cable stack machine and a rope grip. It can either be performed in an athletic upright stance, or slightly bent over. It both stretches and contracts the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi) as well as providing additional activation to the other upper back muscles and the core. Because the triceps are also isometrically involved in the movement, it is usually performed for higher reps, such as 8-15 reps or more.
Benefits

    Allows lifters to "feel" the lats working and focus on the lower and middle part of the muscles
    Greater range of motion than the straight-arm bar pull-down
    Effective alternative to pull-overs, especially for people with limited overhead shoulder mobility

Lean forward from the hip, keeping your back straight, with your arms extended up in front of you. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your arms straight, extend the shoulder to pull the rope down to your thighs.
    Pause at the bottom of the motion, squeezing your lats.
    Return to the starting position without allowing the weight to fully rest on the stack.

    Power clean

Power clean

The power clean is a full-body movement in which the bar is pulled from the floor and caught in the front rack position in three pulls or phases. The bar is received in the "power" position, with the hips higher than a full-depth squat position. The power clean can be used as a component of the clean and press or clean and jerk, but is also a valuable lift to build explosive power and strength.
Benefits

    Trains speed and power for athletic performance
    Great progressions for the full clean
    Great for improving full-body strength and power

Power clean Instructions
Power clean muscle diagram

Note: This exercise is extremely complex and requires the execution of many phases.

Phase 1: Starting Position

    Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart and toes pointing out slightly.
    Squat down and grasp bar with a closed, pronated grip. Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart outside knees with elbows fully extended.
    Place the bar about 1 inch in front of your shins and over the balls of your feet.
    Your back should be flat or slightly arched, your chest held up and out and your shoulder blades should be retracted.
    Keep your head in a neutral position (in line with vertebral column and not tilted or rotated) with your eyes focused straight ahead. Inhale during this phase.

Phase 2: First Pull Phase

    Lift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale. Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle. Do not bend at the waist yet and do not let the hips rise before the shoulders (this would have the effect of pushing the glutes in the air and stretching the hamstrings.
    Keep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the shoulders over the bar.
    As the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible.

Phase 3: Transition or Scoop Phase

    As the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them. Tip: At this point your thighs should be against the bar.
    Keep the back flat or slightly arched, elbows fully extended and your head neutral. Tip: You will hold your breath until the next phase.

Phase 4: Second Pull Phase

    Inhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes.
    Keep the bar as close to your body as possible. Tip: Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position. Also, keep your shoulders over the bar and arms straight as long as possible.
    When your lower body joints are fully extended, shrug the shoulders upward rapidly without letting the elbows flex yet. Exhale during this portion of the movement.
    As the shoulders reach their highest elevation flex your elbows to begin pulling your body under the bar.
    Continue to pull the arms as high and as long as possible. Tip: Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.

Phase 5: Catch Phase

    After the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar.
    Simultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position.
    Once the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles.
    Catch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement.
    Stand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.

Phase 6: Downward Movement Phase

    Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement.
    Simultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs.
    Squat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor.
    Start over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Begin with a wide grip on the bar, with an overhand or hook grip. The feet should be directly below the hips with the feet turned out. Your knees should be slightly bent, and the torso inclined forward. The spine should be fully extended and the head facing forward. The bar should be at the hips. This will be your starting position.
    Aggressively extend through the legs and hips. At peak extension, shrug the shoulders and allow the elbows to flex to the side.
    As you move your feet into the receiving position, forcefully pull yourself below the bar as you elevate the bar overhead. Receive the bar with your body as low as possible and the arms fully extended overhead.
    Return to a standing position with the weight overhead. Follow by returning the weight to the ground under control.

    Kettlebell sumo deadlift high pull

Kettlebell sumo deadlift high pull

The kettlebell sumo deadlift high pull is a dynamic kettlebell exercise that focuses on the muscles of the posterior chain, including the hamstrings, glutes, traps, rear delts, and upper back. It can be done in lower reps for power or strength, or higher reps for conditioning and fat loss. It can also be a component of a circuit-style kettlebell workout, either for time or reps.
Benefits

    Explosively trains the hips, hamstrings, and glutes
    Strengthens the muscles of the traps (trapezius), upper back, and shoulders
    Works effectively with light or heavy weights
    May be a safer deadlift variation to do for high reps than with a barbell

    Begin by lying on the bench, getting your head beyond the bar if possible. Tuck your feet underneath you and arch your back. Using the bar to help support your weight, lift your shoulder off the bench and retract them, squeezing the shoulder blades together. Use your feet to drive your traps into the bench. Maintain this tight body position throughout the movement.
    However wide your grip, it should cover the ring on the bar. Pull the bar out of the rack without protracting your shoulders. Focus on squeezing the bar and trying to pull it apart.
    Lower the bar to your lower chest or upper stomach. The bar, wrist, and elbow should stay in line at all times.
    Pause when the barbell touches your torso, and then drive the bar up with as much force as possible. The elbows should be tucked in until lockout.

Rocking Standing Calf Raise Instructions
Rocking Standing Calf Raise muscle diagram

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place it on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck).
    Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance. Also maintain a straight back and keep the knees with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position.
    Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending (other than the slight initial bend we created during positioning) at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
    Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.
    Now lift your toes by contracting the tibia muscles in the front of the calves as you breathe out.
    Hold for a second and bring them back down as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury. Also, choose a conservative weight. This exercise requires a lot of balance and choosing too much weight may cause you to lose balance and fall.

Variations: A smith machine can be used for this exercise as well and it is a better choice for those with poor balance. Dumbbells can be used also.

    Goblet Squat

Goblet Squat

The goblet squat is a popular lower-body exercise where you hold a kettlebell or dumbbell in front of your chest as if you are supporting a heavy cup or goblet. It can help lifters of all levels improve their squat technique and hip mobility, but can also work as a muscle-building or strength accessory movement for experienced athletes. It also works well in combinations, complexes, and flows with other kettlebell movements like swings, presses, and cleans.
Benefits

    Excellent drill to learn and master proper squat form
    Works the legs dynamically and the upper back, core, and shoulders isometrically
    Easier to squat deeply with good form than barbell squats
    Scalable for beginners, but can also works with heavy weights for more advanced lifters

    Behind-the-head skullcrusher

Behind-the-head skullcrusher

The behind-the-head skullcrusher is a variation on a triceps exercise that has been a staple of bodybuilders for decades. In this version, instead of the bar coming down lightly to the forehead, the bar tracks over the top of the head without touching it. Skullcrushers are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout. If a straight bar is uncomfortable for your wrists or elbows, try using an angled EZ-bar.
Benefits

    Builds muscle and strength in all three heads of the triceps
    Targets the long head specifically

    Type: Strength

Behind-the-head skullcrusher Instructions
Behind-the-head skullcrusher muscle diagram

    While holding a barbell or EZ Curl bar with a pronated grip (palms facing forward), lie on your back on a flat bench with your head close to the end of the bench. Tip: If you are holding a barbell grab it using a shoulder-width grip and if you are using an E-Z Bar grab it on the inner handles.
    Extend your arms in front of you and slowly bring the bar back in a semi circular motion (while keeping the arms extended) to a position over your head. At the end of this step your arms should be overhead and perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: Keep your elbows in at all times.
    As you inhale, lower the bar by bending at the elbows and while keeping the upper arm stationary. Keep lowering the bar until your forearms are perpendicular to the floor.
    As you exhale bring the bar back up to the starting position by pushing the bar up in a semi-circular motion until the lower arms are also parallel to the floor. Contract the triceps hard at the top of the movement for a second. Tip: Again, only the forearms should move. The upper arms should remain stationary at all times.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: You can use dumbbells to make the exercise more challenging.

Reverse Cable Curl muscle diagram

    Stand up with your torso upright while holding a bar attachment that is attached to a low pulley using a pronated (palms down) and shoulder width grip. Make sure also that you keep the elbows close to the torso. This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the muscle.
    Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also perform this movement using an E-Z barbell or straight barbell.

    Dumbbell side bend

Dumbbell side bend

The dumbbell side bend is a popular exercise for targeting the oblique muscles of the abdomen. It is usually performed for relatively high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set or more. It can be performed one side at a time or alternating sides.
Benefits

    Strong obliques help maintain proper posture while protecting the spine
    Aesthetically adds sweep and V-taper shape to the sides of the waist
    Builds size and definition in obliques

Dumbbell side bend Instructions
Dumbbell side bend muscle diagram

    Stand up straight while holding a dumbbell on the left hand (palms facing the torso) as you have the right hand holding your waist. Your feet should be placed at shoulder width. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping your back straight and your head up, bend only at the waist to the right as far as possible. Breathe in as you bend to the side. Then hold for a second and come back up to the starting position as you exhale. Tip: Keep the rest of the body stationary.
    Now repeat the movement but bending to the left instead. Hold for a second and come back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then change hands.

Caution: Refrain from using this exercise if your obliques tend to grow easily as wide obliques take away from your symmetry.

Variations: You can also do this exercise while seating on a bench or with a barbell.

    Lat pull-down

Lat pull-down

The lat pull-down is a cable-based exercise that's ubiquitous in gyms around the world. This back builder is easy to learn and highly effective at building back size and strength. It's usually trained in moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set. If grip strength is a limitation, you can wear wrist straps.
Benefits

    Targets the latissimus dorsi muscles
    Cables provide constant tension on the muscles
    Easy to add variations in grip width, style, or torso angle for variety

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Lats

Lat pull-down Instructions
Lat pull-down muscle diagram

    Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
    Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.
    As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
    As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.
    After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.
    Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations: The behind the neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.

    Alternating incline dumbbell biceps curl

Alternating incline dumbbell biceps curl

The alternating incline dumbbell biceps curl is an exercise targeting the biceps and performed face up on an incline bench.

Benefits

    Greater time under tension than double curls
    Adds size and definition to the biceps
    Positioning on the incline bench helps isolate the biceps and enforce strict form
    Great burnout movement on arm day

    Kettlebell One-Legged Deadlift

Kettlebell One-Legged Deadlift

The kettlebell single-leg deadlift is a variation on the kettlebell deadlift where one foot stays planted on the ground while the other raises into the air at the bottom of the movement. It's popular in lower-body training for strength and muscle building, but also trains balance, grip, and the core muscles.
Benefits

    Targets each glute individually to strengthen both sides equally
    Builds back and glute strength and size, as well as grip strength
    Teaches and enforces the hip hinge movement pattern for deadlifts
    If balance is a challenge, the movement is still effective if you hold on to a post or other stable object

    Continue lowering the kettlebell until you are parallel to the ground, and then return to the upright position.

Alternate Hammer Curl Instructions
Alternate Hammer Curl muscle diagram

    Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell in each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso.
    The palms of the hands should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the right weight forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Continue the movement until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Tip: Only the forearms should move.
    Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in.
    Repeat the movement with the left hand. This equals one repetition.
    Continue alternating in this manner for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by doing both arms at the same time.

Same as the Hammer Curl but you alternate arms.

Knee raises are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of ab-focused training.
Benefits

    Strengthens the abs and hip flexors
    Emphasizes the lower part of the rectus abdominis or "six-pack" muscles
    Difficulty can be increased by holding a dumbbell between the ankles

Captain's chair knee raise muscle diagram

    Position your body on the vertical leg raise bench so that your forearms are resting on the pads next to the torso and holding on to the handles. Your arms will be bent at a 90 degree angle.
    The torso should be straight with the lower back pressed against the pad of the machine and the legs extended pointing towards the floor. This will be your starting position.
    Now as you breathe out, lift your legs up as you keep them extended. Continue this movement until your legs are roughly parallel to the floor and then hold the contraction for a second. Tip: Do not use any momentum or swinging as you perform this exercise.
    Slowly go back to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: As you become more advanced you can start to rotate your pelvis forward at the top of the movement to really engage the lower abs. You may also straighten your legs to increase the difficulty of this movement.

Triceps Pushdown

The cable V-bar push-down is a popular gym exercise for targeting the triceps. It utilizes an angled bar, which can allow you to move heavier weights more comfortably than a straight bar or rope. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more per set, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.
Benefits

    High level of triceps activation and pump, particularly in the lateral head
    The angled handle may activate triceps to a greater degree than a straight bar
    Allows you to move heavier weight than the rope push-down

Triceps Pushdown Instructions
Triceps Pushdown muscle diagram

    Attach a straight or angled bar to a high pulley and grab with an overhand grip (palms facing down) at shoulder width.
    Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. This is your starting position.
    Using the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.
    After a second hold at the contracted position, bring the bar slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a V-angled bar that allows the thumb to be higher than the small finger. Also, you can attach a rope to the pulley as well as using a reverse grip on the bar exercises.

    Attach a rope to a low pulley. After selecting an appropriate weight, grasp the rope with both hands and face away from the cable.
    Position your hands behind your head with your elbows point straight up. Your elbows should start out flexed, and you can stagger your stance and lean gently away from the machine to create greater stability. This will be your starting position.
    To perform the movement, extend through the elbow while keeping the upper arm in position, raising your hands above your head.
    Squeeze your triceps at the top of the movement, and slowly lower the weight back to the start position.

    Single-arm cable cross-over

Single-arm cable cross-over

The single-arm cable cross-over is an isolation movement that uses a cable stack to build bigger and stronger pectoral muscles. Working the chest one side at a time allows you to focus on the balance between the sides of your chest and really feel the chest muscles contracting. It is common in upper-body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, often in combination with other presses or flyes to target the chest from different angles.
Benefits

    Unlike dumbbells, cables provide constant tension, including at peak contraction
    Can quickly switch weights for dropsets
    Stretches the chest muscles under load which can lead to greater muscle gain

    Type: Strength

    Begin by moving the pulleys to the high position, select the resistance to be used, and take a handle in each hand.
    Step forward in front of both pulleys with your arms extended in front of you, bringing your hands together. Your head and chest should be up as you lean forward, while your feet should be staggered. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your left arm in place, allow your right arm to extend out to the side, maintaining a slight bend at the elbow. The right arm should be perpendicular to the body at approximately shoulder level.
    Return your arm back to the starting position by pulling your hand back to the midline of the body.
    Hold for a second at the starting position and repeat the movement on the opposite side. Continue alternating back and forth for the prescribed number of repetitions.

Seated dumbbell biceps curl Instructions
Seated dumbbell biceps curl muscle diagram

    Sit on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso.
    Rotate the palms of the hands so that they are facing your torso. This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights and start twisting the wrists once the dumbbells pass your thighs so that the palms of your hands face forward at the end of the movement. Make sure that you contract the biceps as you breathe out and make sure that only the forearms move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
    Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to the starting position as your breathe in and as you rotate the wrists back to a neutral grip.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.

Battle ropes

Battle ropes are an explosive training tool that involves moving the rope in waves with the other end of the rope anchored at ground level. There are many different types of waves, but the most common is alternating waves with the left and right hands. The battle ropes can be performed for short bursts as power training, for longer durations as cardiovascular training, or as a component of a conditioning or fat-loss circuit.
Benefits

    Intense power training and cardiovascular and grip challenge
    Because there is no eccentric component to the movement, it results in very little muscle soreness
    Serious "pump" to the shoulders and upper back
    There are many different variations such as alternating waves, identical waves, circles, power slams, and lateral waves

    For this exercise you will need a heavy rope anchored at its center 15-20 feet away. Standing in front of the rope, take an end in each hand with your arms extended at your side. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by rapidly raising one arm to shoulder level as quickly as you can.
    As you let that arm drop to the starting position, raise the opposite side.
    Continue alternating your left and right arms, whipping the ropes up and down as fast as you can.

    Begin lying on your back with your hands extended above you toward the ceiling.
    Bring your feet, knees, and hips up to 90 degrees.
    Exhale hard to bring your ribcage down and flatten your back onto the floor, rotating your pelvis up and squeezing your glutes. Hold this position throughout the movement. This will be your starting position.

    You can attach the chains to the sleeves of the bar, or just drape the middle over the bar so there is a greater weight increase as you lift.
    Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets. With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar.
    Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.
    Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.

Rope Crunch

The kneeling cable crunch is a popular core isolation exercise using a rope attachment and cable stack while kneeling on the floor. It primarily targets the rectus abdominus or "six-pack" muscles, but also strengthens the deep core muscles. It is most commonly performed early in an ab workout, usually in moderate to high reps like 8-12 reps per set or higher.
Benefits

    Great way to load abs with weight that can be tracked and increased over time
    Greater range of motion than a traditional sit-up or crunch
    Weighted ab training can increase core definition in addition to strength

Palms-Up Dumbbell Wrist Curl Over A Bench muscle diagram

    Start out by placing two dumbbells on one side of a flat bench.
    Kneel down on both of your knees so that your body is facing the flat bench.
    Use your arms to grab both of the dumbbells with a supinated grip (palms up) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the flat bench. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge.
    Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling.
    Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling. Make sure to inhale during this part of the exercise.
    Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can also be performed sitting down by using your thighs as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over your knees and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed.
    You can also use a barbell instead of a dumbbell.

    Kettlebell thruster

Kettlebell thruster

The kettlebell thruster is a popular kettlebell movement that combines a kettlebell front squat with a kettlebell press, while holding the bell in a goblet or bottoms-up grip. It is preceded by a clean at the start of each set, and you can perform a clean between each rep if you choose. It can be trained in traditional strength or muscle-building rep ranges, in circuit or fat-loss training, or as part of a larger kettlebell combination or complex.
Benefits

    Full-body training that challenges the lower body as well as the shoulders, arms, back, and core
    Encourages proper squat form and depth with an upright torso
    The curl at the bottom of the squat encourages hip mobility and core activation
    The bottoms-up hold strengthens grip, wrists, and biceps

    Clean two kettlebells to your shoulders. Clean the kettlebells to your shoulders by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the kettlebells towards your shoulders. Rotate your wrists as you do so. This will be your starting position.
    Begin to squat by flexing your hips and knees, lowering your hips between your legs. Maintain an upright, straight back as you descend as low as you can.
    At the bottom, reverse direction and squat by extending your knees and hips, driving through your heels. As you do so, press both kettlebells overhead by extending your arms straight up, using the momentum from the squat to help drive the weights upward.
    As you begin the next repetition, return the weights to the shoulders.

    Begin laying prone on the ground. Move yourself into a position supporting your weight on your toes and one arm. Your working arm should be placed directly under the shoulder, fully extended. Your legs should be extended, and for this movement you may need a wider base, placing your feet further apart than in a normal push-up.
    Maintain good posture, and place your free hand behind your back. This will be your starting position.
    Lower yourself by allowing the elbow to flex until you touch the ground.
    Descend slowly, and reverse direction be extending the arm to return to the starting position.

    Single-arm kettlebell clean

Single-arm kettlebell clean

The single-arm kettlebell clean is an explosive kettlebell exercise where the lifter pulls the weight to shoulder level in a single movement. While the kettlebell clean is often used as a transitional movement into the press or front squat, it is also a valuable strength and power exercise in its own right. It can be performed in low rep ranges for strength or higher rep ranges for technique practice or muscle growth.
Benefits

    Strengthens the hips and glutes, upper back, shoulders, and biceps
    Can be used on its own or to transition into a front squat or clean and press
    Effective for strength training or as part of a kettlebell circuit or flow

    Type: Strength

    Place the upper part of both arms on top of the preacher bench as you hold a dumbbell in each hand with the palms facing each other (neutral grip).
    As you breathe in, slowly lower the dumbbells until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched.
    As you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder height.
    Squeeze the biceps hard for a second at the contracted position and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can be performed using one arm at a time to better isolate your biceps or in alternating fashion.
    You can perform this exercise also using a low pulley instead of a dumbbell. In this case you will need to position the bench in front of the pulley.

    Stand with your torso straight and your head up. Your feet should be about shoulder width and your elbows close to your torso. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will keep your upper arms and elbows stationary throughout the movement.
    Curl the bar up in a semicircular motion until the forearms touch your biceps. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and contract your biceps hard for a second at the top. Tip: Avoid bending the back or using swinging motions as you lift the weight. Only the forearms should move.
    Slowly go back down to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: Can also be done with a medium or wide grip, using dumbbells and cables.

The box jump is an explosive exercise that strengthens the muscles of the lower body, including the quads, glutes, calves, and hamstrings. They also develop power in the lower body while revving the heart rate. Box jumps can be performed for low reps to focus on strength and power, or for higher reps for metabolic conditioning. Most coaches recommend stepping down rather than jumping down between reps.
Benefits

    Improves leg power and explosiveness
    Burns a ton of calories
    Excellent contrast movement with heavy squats or deadlifts
    Box height can be customized to ability level

The standing barbell overhead triceps extension is an isolation movement targeting the triceps. The overhead position targets the long head of the triceps in particular. This movement is generally performed for moderate to high reps as part of the arms-focused portion of a workout. If holding a straight bar bothers the wrists or elbows, it can alternately be performed with an EZ-bar or neutral-grip bar.
Benefits

    Hits all three heads of the triceps
    Requires core strength and good lumbar positioning
    Can also be done seated or using alternative bars for comfort
    Can be loaded heavily

    To begin, stand up holding a barbell or e-z bar using a pronated grip (palms facing forward) with your hands closer than shoulder width apart from each other. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart.
    Now elevate the barbell above your head until your arms are fully extended. Keep your elbows in. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your upper arms close to your head and elbows in, perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.
    Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the barbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: Another way to perform this exercise is to use dumbbells or a triceps blaster bar. You can also use cables with a bar or rope attachment.

    Lie on a flat bench and grasp the straight bar attachment of a low pulley with a narrow overhand grip. Tip: The easiest way to do this is to have someone hand you the bar as you lay down.
    With your arms extended, position the bar over your torso. Your arms and your torso should create a 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.
    Lower the bar by bending at the elbow while keeping the upper arms stationary and elbows in. Go down until the bar lightly touches your forehead. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Flex the triceps as you lift the bar back to its starting position. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also perform this exercise with a barbell, an E-Z bar, an E-Z bar cable attachment, and dumbbells.

Cable Internal Rotation muscle diagram

    Sit next to a low pulley sideways (with legs stretched in front of you or crossed) and grasp the single hand cable attachment with the arm nearest to the cable. Tip: If you can adjust the pulley’s height, you can use a flat bench to sit on instead.
    Position the elbow against your side with the elbow bent at 90° and the arm pointing towards the pulley. This will be your starting position.
    Pull the single hand cable attachment toward your body by internally rotating your shoulder until your forearm is across your abs. You will be creating an imaginary semi-circle. Tip: The forearm should be perpendicular to your torso at all times.
    Slowly go back to the initial position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then repeat the movement with the next arm.

Caution: Do not use heavy weights for this exercise as if you use too much you risk rotator cuff injury.

Variations: You can use dumbbells for this movement as well as exercise bands.

Leg Extensions Instructions
Leg Extensions muscle diagram

    For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg (just above your feet). Also, make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.
    Using your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position.
    Slowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of times.

Variations: As mentioned at in the foot positioning section, you can use various foot positions in order to maximize stimulation of certain thigh areas. Also, you can perform the movement unilaterally (one leg at a time).

Benefits

    More difficult than traditional push-ups
    Increases challenge to chest and triceps
    Can add pauses or manipulate tempo to increase difficulty

Close push-up to wide push-up muscle diagram

    Lie on the floor face down and body straight with your toes on the floor and the hands wider than shoulder width for a wide hand position and closer than shoulder width for a close hand position. Make sure you are holding your torso up at arms length.
    Lower yourself until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale.
    Using your pectoral muscles, press your upper body back up to the starting position and squeeze your chest. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    After a second pause at the contracted position, repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, you can either bend your legs at the knees to take off resistance or perform the exercise against the wall instead of the floor.
    For the most advanced lifters, you can place your feet at a high surface such as a bench in order to increase the resistance and to target the upper chest more.

    Single-arm dumbbell triceps extension

Single-arm dumbbell triceps extension

The single-arm dumbbell triceps extension is a popular exercise targeting the triceps one side at a time. It targets all three heads of the triceps, but when performed with the arm overhead, it can be especially effective at building the long head of the triceps. This exercise is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of the upper-body or arm-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Adds size and definition to the triceps
    Great way to target the long head of the triceps
    Can be done seated or standing
    Serious stretch and contraction on each arm

    Type: Strength

Single-arm dumbbell triceps extension Instructions
Single-arm dumbbell triceps extension muscle diagram

    Grab a dumbbell and either sit on a military press bench or a utility bench that has a back support on it as you place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs or stand up straight.
    Clean the dumbbell up to bring it to shoulder height and then extend the arm over your head so that the whole arm is perpendicular to the floor and next to your head. The dumbbell should be on top of you. The other hand can be kept fully extended to the side, by the waist, supporting the upper arm that has the dumbbell or grabbing a fixed surface.
    Rotate the wrist so that the palm of your hand is facing forward and the pinkie is facing the ceiling. This will be your starting position.
    Slowly lower the dumbbell behind your head as you hold the upper arm stationary. Inhale as you perform this movement and pause when your triceps are fully stretched.
    Return to the starting position by flexing your triceps as you breathe out. Tip: It is imperative that only the forearm moves. The upper arm should remain at all times stationary next to your head.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and switch arms.

Variations: You can also do this using a rope instead of a dumbbell.

    Sit on the machine with your back flat on the pad.
    Take hold of the handles. Tip: Your upper arms should be positioned parallel to the floor; adjust the machine accordingly. This will be your starting position.
    Push the handles together slowly as you squeeze your chest in the middle. Breathe out during this part of the motion and hold the contraction for a second.

    Decline dumbbell bench press

Decline dumbbell bench press

The decline dumbbell bench press is a popular upper-body exercise targeting the lower pectoral muscles. While it can be a strength-focused movement, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or chest-focused training.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the pecs
    Targets the lower chest
    Allows for natural shoulder and wrist rotation
    May be more shoulder-friendly than barbell presses

Decline dumbbell bench press Instructions
Decline dumbbell bench press muscle diagram

    Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
    Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width.
    Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position.
    Bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe out. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. Tip: Throughout the motion, the forearms should always be perpendicular to the floor.
    As you breathe out, push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up..
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.

Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.

If using really heavy weights, it is best if a partner gives them to you as you lay down.

Variations: You can use an exercise band or a barbell to perform this exercise.

Similar to the Dumbbell Bench Press but on a decline bench. This works more of the lower chest.

Seated face pull

The seated face pull is a cable exercise targeting the shoulder muscles, particularly the rear delts, and the muscles of the upper back.

It is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of a dynamic warm-up for an upper-body workout or in the main part of a shoulder-focused workout.
Benefits

    Builds strength and size in the shoulders, traps, and upper back
    Great mind-muscle connection with light to moderate weight
    Cables provide constant tension on the muscles

    Sit on a low pulley row machine with a rope attachment.
    Grab the ends of the rope using a palms-down grip and sit with your back straight and your knees slightly bent. Tip: Keep your back almost completely vertical and your arms fully extended in front of you. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping your torso stationary, lift your elbows and start bending them as you pull the rope towards your neck while exhaling. Throughout the movement your upper arms should remain parallel to the floor. Tip: Continue this motion until your hands are almost next to your ears (the forearms will not be parallel to the floor at the end of the movement as they will be angled a bit upwards) and your elbows are out away from your sides.
    After holding for a second or so at the contracted position, come back slowly to the starting position as you inhale. Tip: Again, during no part of the movement should the torso move.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: You can use a straight bar attachment as well or a bench and exercise bands.

    Quadriceps
    Barbell Bulgarian split squat

Barbell Bulgarian split squat

The barbell Bulgarian split squat is a single-leg exercise targeting the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. It is easier to overload with the barbell than when using dumbbells. If balance is an issue, consider using a Smith machine or holding dumbbells at your side instead.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength throughout the lower body
    Works the core, upper back, and lower back to maintain stability and positioning
    Many find single-leg squat variations easier on the spine and knees than bilateral back squats

    Type: Strength

    Start by standing about 2 to 3 feet in front of a flat bench with your back facing the bench. Have a barbell in front of you on the floor. Tip: Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other.
    Bend the knees and use a pronated grip with your hands being wider than shoulder width apart from each other to lift the barbell up until you can rest it on your chest.
    Then lift the barbell over your head and rest it on the base of your neck. Move one foot back so that your toe is resting on the flat bench. Your other foot should be stationary in front of you. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. Tip: Make sure your back is straight and chest is out while performing this exercise.
    As you inhale, slowly lower your leg until your thigh is parallel to the floor. At this point, your knee should be over your toes. Your chest should be directly above the middle of your thigh.
    Leading with the chest and hips and contracting the quadriceps, elevate your leg back to the starting position as you exhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Switch legs and repeat the movement.

Variations: You can use a step up box to place your toes on to perform this exercise. You can even elevate the step up box. Note: the higher the step up box, the more difficult it is to perform this exercise.

Caution: Keeping your balance with this exercise can be challenging. This is an advanced exercise and should not be performed unless you are an experienced weight lifter.

    Reverse-grip lat pull-down

Reverse-grip lat pull-down

The reverse-grip lat pull-down is variation on the lat pull-down that targets the lower lats more than an overhand grip. Because the hands are relatively close together, it also increases the range of motion beyond wider-grip pull-down variations. It can be performed for low reps, such as 5-6 per set, for back strength, or for higher reps for size.
Benefits

    Targets the lower lats and biceps
    Easy to learn and execute
    Cables provide constant tension on the targeted muscles

Reverse-grip lat pull-down Instructions
Reverse-grip lat pull-down muscle diagram

    Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
    Grab the pull-down bar with the palms facing your torso (a supinated grip). Make sure that the hands are placed closer than the shoulder width.
    As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
    As you breathe out, pull the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the fully contracted position and keep the elbows close to your body. The upper torso should remain stationary as your bring the bar to you and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
    After a second on the contracted position, while breathing in, slowly bring the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.
    Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Standing Biceps Cable Curl

The cable straight-bar biceps curl takes a classic bodybuilding exercise, the standing barbell curl, and replaces the barbell with a handle attached to a cable. This is a common burnout move performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.
Benefits

    Builds stronger, more muscular biceps
    Unlike a barbell, the cable allows for continuous tension
    Easy to change the load quickly for dropsets

    Stand up with your torso upright while holding a cable curl bar that is attached to a low pulley. Grab the cable bar at shoulder width and keep the elbows close to the torso. The palm of your hands should be facing up (supinated grip). This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the muscle.
    Slowly begin to bring the curl bar back to starting position as your breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: You can also perform this movement using an E-Z barbell attachment or single handles.

    Single-arm cable seated row

Single-arm cable seated row

The single-arm cable seated row is a version of the cable row movement that trains the muscles of the upper back one side at a time. It targets a wide range of muscles including the lats (latissimus dorsi), traps, rhomboids, and rear deltoids. It also targets the biceps to a lesser degree. The single-arm row can work well in a variety of rep ranges but is most popular in muscle-building workouts or as an accessory movement for strength workouts.
Benefits

    Uses equipment common in commercial gyms
    Cable provides constant tension throughout the movement, including at peak contraction
    Easy to quickly switch weights for dropsets

    To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.
    Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the single handle attachment with your left arm using a palms-down grip.
    With your arm extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lat as you hold the bar in front of you. The right arm can be kept by the waist. This is the starting position of the exercise.
    Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it as you rotate the wrist, so that by the time your hand is by your abdominals it is in a neutral position (palms facing the torso). Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard.
    Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. Tip: Remember to rotate the wrist as you go back to the starting position so that the palms are facing down again.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the right hand.

Variations: You can perform this movement with a high pulley as well and standing up. You can also perform it doing a full rotation of the wrist. In other words, at the starting position you will have the palms of the hands facing down and at the end of the movement they will be facing up. Great movement to perform for a variety of purposes.

    Single-arm kettlebell row

Single-arm kettlebell row

The single-arm kettlebell row is a popular muscle- and strength-building exercise that works the muscles of the back and core simultaneously. It has all the same benefits as a single-arm dumbbell row, but some people find a kettlebell more comfortable to hold during the movement.
Benefits

    Trains the muscles of the upper back one at a time, allowing you to focus on each side
    The muscles of the core must work hard to resist rotation
    The muscles of the lower back and glutes also contract isometrically during the set

    Type: Strength

    Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in one hand on top of your thigh.
    By using your thigh to help you get the dumbbell up, clean the dumbbell up so that you can hold it in front of you at shoulder width. Use the hand you are not lifting with to help position the dumbbell over you properly.
    Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrist forward so that the palm of your hand is facing away from you. This will be your starting position.
    Bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe in. Keep full control of the dumbbell at all times. Tip: Use the hand that you are not lifting with to help keep the dumbbell balance as you may struggle a bit at first. Only use your non-lifting hand if it is needed. Otherwise, keep it resting to the side.
    As you breathe out, push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.
    Switch arms and repeat the movement.

Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbell next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.

Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrist so that you can place the dumbbell on top of your thigh. When the dumbbell is touching your thigh simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbell on your thigh) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbell on top of the thigh). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with the dumbbell still on top of your thigh. At this moment you can place the dumbbell on the floor.

    Set up in a power rack with the bar on the pins. The pins should be set to the desired point; just below the knees, just above, or in the mid thigh position. Attach bands to the base of the rack, or secure them with dumbbells. Attach the other end to the bar. You may need to choke the bands to provide tension.
    Position yourself against the bar in proper deadlifting position. Your feet should be under your hips, your grip shoulder width, back arched, and hips back to engage the hamstrings. Since the weight is typically heavy, you may use a mixed grip, a hook grip, or use straps to aid in holding the weight.
    With your head looking forward, extend through the hips and knees, pulling the weight up and back until lockout. Be sure to pull your shoulders back as you complete the movement. Return the weight to the pins and repeat.

Hang Clean - Below the Knees muscle diagram

    Begin with a shoulder width, double overhand or hook grip, with the bar hanging just below the knees. Your back should be straight and inclined slightly forward.
    Begin by aggressively extending through the hips, knees and ankles, driving the weight upward. As you do so, shrug your shoulders towards your ears. As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out.
    At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.
    Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.

    Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench.
    Raise your upper body off the bench until your torso is about 35-45 degrees if measured from the floor.
    Put one hand beside your head and the other on your thigh. This will be your starting position.
    Raise your upper body slowly from the starting position while turning your torso to the left. Continue crunching up as you exhale until your right elbow touches your left knee. Hold this contracted position for a second. Tip: Focus on keeping your abs tight and keeping the movement slow and controlled.
    Lower your body back down slowly to the starting position as you inhale.
    After completing one set on the right for the recommended amount of repetitions, switch to your left side. Tip: Focus on really twisting your torso and feeling the contraction when you are in the up position.

Variations: You can perform this exercise on a flat surface or you can also alternate from side to side in each repetition.

Dumbbell external shoulder rotation

The dumbbell external shoulder rotation is a lightweight dumbbell exercise intended to maintain the health of the shoulder joints, including the rotator cuffs. It is often used as a warm-up or prehab for a shoulder or chest-focused workout with lots of pressing.
Benefits

    Works the often-overlooked rotator cuff muscles
    Great injury prevention move for athletes who throw, such as baseball pitchers
    Requires only a bench and one light dumbbell
    Helps build shoulder stability

Dumbbell external shoulder rotation Instructions
Dumbbell external shoulder rotation muscle diagram

    Lie sideways on a flat bench with one arm holding a dumbbell and the other hand on top of the bench folded so that you can rest your head on it.
    Bend the elbows of the arm holding the dumbbell so that it creates a 90-degree angle between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the arm parallel to your torso.
    Now bend the elbow while keeping the upper arm stationary. In this manner, the forearm will be parallel to the floor and perpendicular to your torso (Tip: So the forearm will be directly in front of you). The upper arm will be stationary by your torso and should be parallel to the floor (aligned with your torso at all times). This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe out, externally rotate your forearm so that the dumbbell is lifted up in a semicircle motion as you maintain the 90 degree angle bend between the upper arms and the forearm. You will continue this external rotation until the forearm is perpendicular to the floor and the torso pointing towards the ceiling. At this point you will hold the contraction for a second.
    As you breathe in, slowly go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then switch to the other arm.

Caution: There is no need to go heavy with this exercise. Too much weight will cause rotator cuff injury.

Variations: You can perform this exercise standing and with cables.

    Select a weight and hold the handle of the low pulley with your right hand.
    Bend at the waist until your torso is nearly parallel to the floor. Your legs should be slightly bent with your left hand placed on your lower left thigh. Your right arm should be hanging from your shoulder in front of you and with a slight bend at the elbow. This will be your starting position.
    Raise your right arm, elbow slightly bent, to the side until the arm is parallel to the floor and in line with your right ear. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    Slowly lower the weight back to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and repeat the movement with the other arm.

Clean Instructions
Clean muscle diagram

    With a barbell on the floor close to the shins, take an overhand (or hook) grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.

    Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.

    Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.

    As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.

    Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.

    Single-arm incline lateral raise

Single-arm incline lateral raise

The single-arm incline lateral raise is an exercise targeting the lateral or medial head of the shoulder muscles. It is performed lying sideways on an incline bench set to around 45 degrees, which helps to increase the range of motion in the lift and enforce strict form. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the middle deltoids
    Enforces strict form and eliminates momentum
    Increased range of motion over standing lateral raises
    Intense shoulder training even with light weight

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Shoulders

    Lie down sideways on an incline bench press with a dumbbell in the hand. Make sure the shoulder is pressing against the incline bench and the arm is lying across your body with the palm around your navel.
    Hold a dumbbell in your uppermost arm while keeping it extended in front of you parallel to the floor. This is your starting position.
    While keeping the dumbbell parallel to the floor at all times, perform a lateral raise. Your arm should travel straight up until it is pointing at the ceiling. Tip: Exhale as you perform this movement. Hold the dumbbell in the position and feel the contraction in the shoulders for a second.
    While inhaling lower the weight across your body back into the starting position.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the movement.

    Decline bar press sit-up

Decline bar press sit-up

The decline bar press sit-up is a weighted core exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, particularly the lower abs. It also challenges the shoulders and upper back to move the weight. Weighted sit-up variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the core-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Allows you to train in lower rep ranges when bodyweight decline sit-ups become too easy
    Weighted ab training can help the core muscles grow and look more defined
    Also challenges the shoulders, serratus anterior, upper back, and hip flexors

    To begin, lie down on a bench with a barbell resting on your chest. Position your legs so they are secure on the extension of the abdominal bench. This is the starting position.
    While inhaling, tighten your abdominals and glutes. Simultaneously curl your torso as you do when performing a sit-up and press the barbell to an overhead position while exhaling. Tip: Use your arms to push the barbell out as you perform this exercise while still focusing on the abdominal muscles.
    Lower your upper body back down to the starting position while bringing the barbell back down to your torso. Remember to breathe in while lowering the body.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: It is best to have a spotter while performing this exercise so that it is easier to get the barbell and also get rid of it. Also, always start with an empty bar and do not use jerking motions at any time.

Variations: You can also use a decline bench when you are more advanced.

    Barbell rear delt bent-over row

Barbell rear delt bent-over row

The barbell rear delt bent-over row is a movement used to target the shoulders as well as the upper-back muscles. It is performed with lighter weights than a traditional barbell bent-over row, and is usually performed for higher reps, such as 8-15 reps per set, as part of a back or upper-body workout.
Benefits

    Wide elbow positioning targets the rear delts, traps, and upper back
    Can be performed with a Smith machine, T-bar row, or pulley with wide-grip attachment
    Teaches proper ab bracing and maintains positioning of the spine

    Type: Strength

    Stand up straight while holding a barbell using a wide (higher than shoulder width) and overhand (palms facing your body) grip.
    Bend knees slightly and bend over as you keep the natural arch of your back. Let the arms hang in front of you as they hold the bar. Once your torso is parallel to the floor, flare the elbows out and away from your body. Tip: Your torso and your arms should resemble the letter "T". Now you are ready to begin the exercise.
    While keeping the upper arms perpendicular to the torso, pull the barbell up towards your upper chest as you squeeze the rear delts and you breathe out. Tip: When performed correctly, this exercise should resemble a bench press in reverse. Also, refrain from using your biceps to do the work. Focus on targeting the rear delts; the arms should only act as hooks.
    Slowly go back to the initial position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise using a smith machine or a T-bar row. You can also use the low pulley as long as you use a wide grip bar attachment.

    Adjust the seat so that your legs are only slightly bent in the start position. The balls of your feet should be firmly on the platform.
    Select an appropriate weight, and grasp the handles. This will be your starting position.
    Straighten the legs by extending the knees, just barely lifting the weight from the stack. Your ankle should be fully flexed, toes pointing up. Execute the movement by pressing downward through the balls of your feet as far as possible.
    After a brief pause, reverse the motion and repeat.

    Place two kettlebells on the floor about shoulder width apart. Position yourself on your toes and your hands as though you were doing a pushup, with the body straight and extended. Use the handles of the kettlebells to support your upper body. You may need to position your feet wide for support.
    Push one kettlebell into the floor and row the other kettlebell, retracting the shoulder blade of the working side as you flex the elbow, pulling it to your side.
    Then lower the kettlebell to the floor and begin the kettlebell in the opposite hand. Repeat for several reps.

    Connect a standard handle to each arm of a cable machine, and position them in the most downward position.
    Grab a Bosu Ball and position it in front and center of the cable machine.
    Lie down on the Bosu Ball with the small of your back arched around the ball. Your rear end should be close to the floor without touching it.
    With both hands, reach back and grab the handle of each cable.
    With your feet positioned in a wide stance, extend your arms straight out in front of you and in between your knees. Your hands should be at knee level.
    Keep your arms straight and in-line with the upward angle of the cable. Elevate your torso in a crunching motion without dropping or bending your arms.
    Maintain the rigid position with your arms. Slowly descend back to the starting position with your back arched around the Bosu Ball and your abdominals elongated.
    Repeat the same series of movements to failure.
    Once you reach failure, keep your abs tight and raise your torso into plank position so your back is elevated off the Bosu Ball.
    Lower your arms down to your side; keep them straight. Start doing alternating side bends; reach for your heels! This finishing movement will focus on your obliques.

Tip: Arch your back around the Bosu Ball before each rep to fully elongate your abdominals. This will provide a full range of motion and lengthen your muscle fibers, giving them a much fuller appearance.

    To begin, stand straight with your feet shoulder width apart from each other. Place your hands on your hips. This is the starting position.
    Now slowly inhale as much air as possible and then start to exhale as much as possible while bringing your stomach in as much as possible and hold this position. Try to visualize your navel touching your backbone.
    One isometric contraction is around 20 seconds. During the 20 second hold, try to breathe normally. Then inhale and bring your stomach back to the starting position.
    Once you have practiced this exercise, try to perform this exercise for longer than 20 seconds. Tip: You can work your way up to 40-60 seconds.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of sets.

Hammer Grip Incline DB Bench Press Instructions
Hammer Grip Incline DB Bench Press muscle diagram

    Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
    By using your thighs to help you get the dumbbells up, clean the dumbbells one arm at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width.
    Once at shoulder width, keep the palms of your hands with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Keep your elbows flared out with the upper arms in line with the shoulders (perpendicular to the torso) and the elbows bent creating a 90-degree angle between the upper arm and the forearm. This will be your starting position.
    Now bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe in. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times.
    As you breathe out, push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, place the dumbbells back in your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to dispose of the dumbbells.

Variations: You can use several angles on the incline bench if the bench you are using is adjustable. Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing forward (which is the traditional manner). Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.

Wide-grip hands-elevated push-up

The wide-grip hands-elevated push-up is a variation on the elevated push-up performed with the hands farther apart than with a standard push-up. Having the hands higher than the feet makes it easier than wide-grip push-ups on the floor, but the extra width also puts more emphasis on the chest muscles. It can be used as a substitute for wide-grip floor push-ups, or as a mechanical dropset after maxing out on floor push-ups.
Benefits

    Stretches and emphasizes the chest muscles
    Effective substitution for wide-grip push-ups in any workout
    Great for burnout sets at the end of a chest or triceps workout

    Type: Strength

    Stand facing a Smith machine bar or sturdy elevated platform at an appropriate height.
    Place your hands on the bar, with your hands wider than shoulder width.
    Position your feet back from the bar with arms and body straight. Your arms should be perpendicular to the body. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your body straight, lower your chest to the bar by bending the arms.
    Return to the starting position by extending the elbows, pressing yourself back up.

Decline Dumbbell Triceps Extension muscle diagram

    Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
    Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width. The palms of the hands should be facing each other and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor and fully extended. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in and you keep the upper arms stationary (and elbows in), bring the dumbbells down slowly by moving your forearms in a semicircular motion towards you until your thumbs are next to your ears. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Lift the dumbbells back to the starting position by contracting the triceps and exhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can use an e-z bar or barbell to perform this movement. You can also perform it on a flat bench as well.

    Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart from each other holding your torso up at arms length.
    Place your toes on top of an exercise ball. This will allow your body to be elevated.
    Lower yourself until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale.
    Using your pectoral muscles, press your upper body back up to the starting position and squeeze your chest. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    After a second pause at the contracted position, repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations: Another way to perform this exercise is to use a flat bench to elevate your body instead of an exercise ball.

    Adjust the weight to an appropriate amount and be seated, grasping the handles. Your upper arms should be about 90 degrees to the body, with your head and chest up. The elbows should also be bent to about 90 degrees. This will be your starting position.
    Begin by extending through the elbow, pressing the handles together above your head.
    After pausing at the top, return the handles to the starting position. Ensure that you maintain tension on the cables.
    You can also execute this movement with your back off the pad and alternate hands.

    Quadriceps
    Barbell hack squat

Barbell hack squat

The barbell hack squat is a variety of deadlift performed with the barbell behind the legs. This forces the lifter into a body position similar to a squat and targets the quads and glutes. It is named after famed strongman George Hackenschmidt, who performed it as an overall leg-building exercise. The barbell hack squat can be used as a substitute for the machine hack squat, or as a lower-body strength and size movement on its own.
Benefits

    Builds the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    If maintaining a neutral spine is difficult, the move can be performed with the bar raised off the ground
    Great carryover to both the squat and deadlift

    Type: Strength

Barbell hack squat Instructions
Barbell hack squat muscle diagram

    Stand up straight while holding a barbell behind you at arms length and your feet at shoulder width. Tip: A shoulder width grip is best with the palms of your hands facing back. You can use wrist wraps for this exercise for a better grip. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping your head and eyes up and back straight, squat until your upper thighs are parallel to the floor. Breathe in as you slowly go down.
    Pressing mainly with the heel of the foot and squeezing the thighs, go back up as you breathe out.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed with your heels slightly elevated on a small block. This is a good option for beginners who lack the flexibility to perform the exercise without it.

    Feet-elevated push-up

Feet-elevated push-up

The feet-elevated push-up is a variation on the push-up, a bodyweight standard. The feet are elevated so that your body is aligned at an angle to the floor rather than parallel. This makes it more difficult than push-ups on the floor, but also puts more emphasis on the shoulder muscles. It is often used as a bodyweight substitute for incline presses, or as a burnout movement for a chest or shoulder workout.
Benefits

    Works the upper chest and front shoulders more than the regular push-up
    Harder than regular push-ups
    You can make it harder still by progressively elevating your feet higher over time

    Type: Strength

    Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart from each other holding your torso up at arms length.
    Place your toes on top of a flat bench. This will allow your body to be elevated. Note: The higher the elevation of the flat bench, the higher the resistance of the exercise is.
    Lower yourself until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale.
    Using your pectoral muscles, press your upper body back up to the starting position and squeeze your chest. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    After a second pause at the contracted position, repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variations: Another way to perform this exercise is to use an exercise ball to elevate your body instead of a flat bench. This adds a level of difficulty due to the instability provided.

Good Morning

The barbell good morning is an exercise that targets glute, hamstring, and lower back development. It is often trained as an accessory movement to the deadlift, but also has value on its own. It is sometimes performed for reps in traditional strength-focused rep ranges such as 5-8 reps per set, but due to the risk posed to the lower back, is rarely treated as a max-effort single-rep lift.
Benefits

    Accessory exercise the deadlift and squat
    Challenges upper back and core strength
    Trains correct hinging motion
    Serious hamstring and glute builder

    Begin with a bar on a rack at shoulder height. Rack the bar across the rear of your shoulders as you would a power squat, not on top of your shoulders. Keep your back tight, shoulder blades pinched together, and your knees slightly bent. Step back from the rack.
    Begin by bending at the hips, moving them back as you bend over to near parallel. Keep your back arched and your cervical spine in proper alignment.
    Reverse the motion by extending through the hips with your glutes and hamstrings. Continue until you have returned to the starting position.

Gironda Sternum Chins muscle diagram

    Grasp the pull-up bar with a shoulder width underhand grip.
    Now hang with your arms fully extended and stick your chest out and lean back. Tip: You will be leaning back throughout the entire movement. This will be your starting position.
    Start pulling yourself towards the bar with your spine arched throughout the movement and your head leaning back as far away from the bar as possible. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: At the upper end of the movement, your hips and legs will be at about a 45-degree angle to the floor.
    Keep pulling until your collarbone passes the bar and your lower chest or sternum area touches it. Hold that contraction for a second. Tip: By the time you've completed this portion of the movement; your head will be parallel to the floor.
    Slowly start going back to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this movement using a chin-assist machine if unable to do it without aid or have a spotter help you up. You can also use the pull-down machine instead even though due to the fact that the pull-down machine does not involve a lot of the stabilizer muscles needed for the chin-up, the exercise becomes less effective. Also, as you get more advanced, you can use a weight belt to increase resistance.

    Exercise ball crunch

Exercise ball crunch

The exercise ball crunch is a popular gym exercise targeting the abdominals. Unlike crunches on the floor or a bench, by using a ball you can increase the range of motion and both stretch and contract the abs on every rep. The ball crunch can be performed for low reps with a slower tempo focusing on a hard contraction, or for higher reps.
Benefits

    Targets the rectus abdominis or "six-pack" muscles
    Stabilizing on the ball works the entire core
    Increased range of motion compared to the floor or a bench

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Abdominals
    Equipment: Exercise Ball

Exercise ball crunch Instructions
Exercise ball crunch muscle diagram

    Lie on an exercise ball with your lower back curvature pressed against the spherical surface of the ball. Your feet should be bent at the knee and pressed firmly against the floor. The upper torso should be hanging off the top of the ball. The arms should either be kept alongside the body or crossed on top of your chest as these positions avoid neck strains (as opposed to the hands behind the back of the head position).
    Lower your torso into a stretch position keeping the neck stationary at all times. This will be your starting position.
    With the hips stationary, flex the waist by contracting the abdominals and curl the shoulders and trunk upward until you feel a nice contraction on your abdominals. The arms should simply slide up the side of your legs if you have them at the side or just stay on top of your chest if you have them crossed. The lower back should always stay in contact with the ball. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second.
    As you inhale, go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Perform this exercise slowly and deliberately as it takes some getting used to. Also, do not be hasty and try to use weights on the first time; you'll have enough on your hands learning how to balance yourself. Also, if balance is an issue I recommend having a spotter next to you and also placing each of your feet under a 100-lb dumbbell for added stability. As you get more advanced you can hold a dumbbell or a weight plate (held at arms length) on top of your chest. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise, because if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with a low pulley behind you with a rope attached on its end. In this manner you can go ahead and add resistance easier. For this variation, you will need to hold on to the sides of the rope throughout the movement. I like to bring my arms forward to the point that the upper arms are almost parallel to my torso and the lower arms are facing back holding the rope.

    Seated rear delt fly

Seated rear delt fly

The seated rear delt fly is an upper-body exercise that targets the real deltoid of the shoulder. By performing the movement seated, it eliminates momentum from the rest of the body. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Promotes shoulder health and balanced development
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day
    Strengthens important postural muscles in the upper back

    Place a couple of dumbbells looking forward in front of a flat bench.
    Sit on the end of the bench with your legs together and the dumbbells behind your calves.
    Bend at the waist while keeping the back straight in order to pick up the dumbbells. The palms of your hands should be facing each other as you pick them. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your torso forward and stationary, and the arms slightly bent at the elbows, lift the dumbbells straight to the side until both arms are parallel to the floor. Exhale as you lift the weights. (Note: avoid swinging the torso or bringing the arms back as opposed to the side.)
    After a one second contraction at the top, slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: This exercise can also be performed standing but those with lower back problems are better off performing this seated variety.

    Lie down on the floor placing your feet either under something that will not move or by having a partner hold them. Your legs should be bent at the knees.
    Elevate your upper body so that it creates an imaginary V-shape with your thighs. Your arms should be fully extended in front of you perpendicular to your torso and with the hands clasped. This is the starting position.
    Twist your torso to the right side until your arms are parallel with the floor while breathing out.
    Hold the contraction for a second and move back to the starting position while breathing out. Now move to the opposite side performing the same techniques you applied to the right side.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: As you get more advanced, you can hold a weight with both arms for resistance.

Also, as you become more advanced you can hold a dumbbell in between your feet or attach a pulley to them for added resistance. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise as if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia.

    Barbell shrug

Barbell shrug

The barbell shrug is an exercise targeting the traps (trapezius muscles). It is popular in strength and muscle-focused upper-body training, and is often trained on a shoulder day. With the assistance of straps, it can be loaded heavily, but it is still usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-10 reps per set.
Benefits

    Works the shoulders and upper-back muscles secondarily
    Adds both size and strength to traps
    Barbell version allows you to overload more easily
    Can increase difficulty by adding a pause at the top

Barbell shrug muscle diagram

    Stand up straight with your feet at shoulder width as you hold a barbell with both hands in front of you using a pronated grip (palms facing the thighs). Tip: Your hands should be a little wider than shoulder width apart. You can use wrist wraps for this exercise for a better grip. This will be your starting position.
    Raise your shoulders up as far as you can go as you breathe out and hold the contraction for a second. Tip: Refrain from trying to lift the barbell by using your biceps.
    Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also rotate your shoulders as you go up, going in a semicircular motion from front to rear. However this version is not good for people with shoulder problems. In addition, this exercise can be performed with the barbell behind the back, with dumbbells by the side, a smith machine or with a shrug machine.

    Sit in the same position on a low pulley row station as you would if you were doing seated cable rows for the back.
    Attach a rope to the pulley and grasp it with an overhand grip. Your arms should be extended and parallel to the floor with the elbows flared out.

    Builds size and strength in the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    Great heavy movement or lighter-weight burnout
    Changing foot placement or toe angle can change the emphasis of the exercise

Hack Squat Instructions
Hack Squat muscle diagram

    Place the back of your torso against the back pad of the machine and hook your shoulders under the shoulder pads provided.
    Position your legs in the platform using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Tip: Keep your head up at all times and also maintain the back on the pad at all times.
    Place your arms on the side handles of the machine and disengage the safety bars (which on most designs is done by moving the side handles from a facing front position to a diagonal position).
    Now straighten your legs without locking the knees. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).
    Begin to slowly lower the unit by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up (back on the pad at all times). Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
    Begin to raise the unit as you exhale by pushing the floor with mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: All foot variations discussed in the foot positioning section apply.

Dumbbell skullcrusher

The dumbbell skullcrusher is a triceps exercise that has been a staple of bodybuilders for decades. Skullcrushers are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.
Benefits

    Builds muscle and strength in the triceps
    Targets the long head specifically
    May be more comfortable for wrists and elbows than barbell skullcrushers

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Triceps
    Equipment: Dumbbell

Dumbbell skullcrusher Instructions
Dumbbell skullcrusher muscle diagram

    Lie on a flat bench while holding two dumbbells directly in front of you. Your arms should be fully extended at a 90-degree angle from your torso and the floor. The palms should be facing in and the elbows should be tucked in. This is the starting position.
    As you breathe in and you keep the upper arms stationary with the elbows in, slowly lower the weight until the dumbbells are near your ears.
    At that point, while keeping the elbows in and the upper arms stationary, use the triceps to bring the weight back up to the starting position as you breathe out.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is an exercise that you need to be very careful with when selecting the weight. Too much weight with sloppy form and you could be looking at injured elbows. Also, if you suffer from elbow problems this exercise might be too harsh on your elbows, so you may need to look for a substitute such as a close-grip bench press.

Variation: You can perform this exercise in an alternate fashion like alternate dumbbell curls.

Man-maker Instructions
Man-maker muscle diagram

    Position a pair of light-weight dumbbells in front of you, parallel to each other. Keeping your back flat, bend forward and squat down, grasping the dumbbells. This is your start position.
    Initiate the movement by kicking one leg back, then the other so that you’re in the push-up position, holding onto the dumbbells. Your weight should be on your toes and hands. Do a one-arm row for each side, bringing your elbow up as high as you can.
    Hop your feet forward and rise up by cleaning the weights, bringing them up to shoulder level, palms facing forward as you hop a second time. Descend into a squat and explosively rise up, then press the weights overhead to full arm extension.
    Lower the dumbbells back to your shoulders, then bend over as you squat down to return the weights back to the floor in front of you. Repeat for reps.

    Pallof press

Pallof press

The Pallof press is an isometric exercise that trains core stability. It involves resisting rotation from a cable or band, developing what is sometimes called "anti-rotation" core strength. It is most often seen in programs for athletes who compete in sports that test strength, power, and functional movements. It can be trained in timed holds or for reps by pressing the cable or band away from the body.
Benefits

    Builds abdominal strength and muscle control
    Works the upper and lower body isometrically to maintain position
    Can also be performed with bands if cables are unavailable

    Connect a standard handle to a tower, and—if possible—position the cable to shoulder height. If not, a low pulley will suffice.
    With your side to the cable, grab the handle with both hands and step away from the tower. You should be approximately arm’s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable.
    With your feet positioned hip-width apart and knees slightly bent, hold the cable to the middle of your chest. This will be your starting position.
    Press the cable away from your chest, fully extending both arms. You core should be tight and engaged.
    Hold the repetition for several seconds before returning to the starting position.
    At the conclusion of the set, repeat facing the other direction.

    To begin, lie down on the floor or an exercise mat with your back pressed against the floor. Your arms should be lying across your sides with the palms facing down.
    Your legs should be crossed by wrapping one ankle around the other. Slowly elevate your legs up in the air until your thighs are perpendicular to the floor with a slight bend at the knees. Note: Your knees and toes should be parallel to the floor as opposed to the thighs.
    Move your arms from the floor and cross them so they are resting on your chest. This is the starting position.
    While keeping your lower back pressed against the floor, slowly lift your torso. Remember to exhale while perform this part of the exercise.
    Slowly begin to lower your torso back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can be performed with a weighted plate resting across your chest with your arms holding it. This can be a bit challenging for those who have never performed this exercise with weights. Always try the exercise without weights before moving to weighted plates.

You can also perform this exercise with your hands clasped behind your head. This is a great way to add variety to your routine.

    Straight-arm dumbbell pull-over

Straight-arm dumbbell pull-over

The straight-arm dumbbell pull-over is an exercise that targets the muscles of the pecs, lats, and serratus anterior muscles. Performing this movement with straight arms makes it more difficult, increases the stretch on the serratus muscles and lats, and forces the core to work harder. Old-school bodybuilders would perform pull-overs with light weights for sets of 20 between sets of heavy 20-rep squats, but they are more popular today in moderate rep ranges, such as 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body workout.
Benefits

    Keeping your elbows straight helps the ribcage expand
    Hits numerous upper-body muscles at once
    Helps make the serratus muscles pop
    Can help improve overhead shoulder mobility

Straight-arm dumbbell pull-over muscle diagram

    Place a dumbbell standing up on a flat bench.

    Ensuring that the dumbbell stays securely placed at the top of the bench, lie perpendicular to the bench (torso across it as in forming a cross) with only your shoulders lying on the surface. Hips should be below the bench and legs bent with feet firmly on the floor. The head will be off the bench as well.

    Grasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest at arms length. Both palms should be pressing against the underside one of the sides of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position.

    Caution: Always ensure that the dumbbell used for this exercise is secure. Using a dumbbell with loose plates can result in the dumbbell falling apart and falling on your face.

    While keeping your arms straight, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest.

    At that point, bring the dumbbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement.

    Hold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions.

Caution: If you are new to this movement, have a spotter hand you the weight instead. If not, please ensure that the dumbbell does not fall on you as you arrange your torso to perform the exercise on the bench. Also, as I already mentioned, ensure that the dumbbell used is in perfect working condition. Old dumbbells in need of welding should never be used to perform this exercise.

Variations:

    You can perform this exercise using a barbell or an e-z bar instead of dumbbells.
    Also, if using dumbbells like Powerblocks™, just use a dumbbell on each hand with the palms of your hands facing each other.

It can be performed for time or reps and is especially effective in a fat-loss or athleticism-focused circuit or workout.
Benefits

    Cardiovascular challenge that also builds endurance, balance, and coordination
    Works core strength to maintain balance and upright position

    Cross your arms over your chest.
    With your head up and your back straight, position your feet at shoulder width.
    Keeping your back straight and chest up, squat down as you inhale until your upper thighs are parallel, or lower, to the floor.
    Now pressing mainly with the ball of your feet, jump straight up in the air as high as possible, using the thighs like springs. Exhale during this portion of the movement.
    When you touch the floor again, immediately squat down and jump again.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Do not perform this movement if you have any knee or back injuries due to the impact involved. Also, make certain that your landings are controlled and that you land with your two feet straight (toes touching the floor first). The wrong landing can result in a sprained ligament.

Variations: You can also perform this movement with a barbell resting on your shoulders or while holding dumbbells by your sides.

Isometric Wipers

The typewriter push-up is an advanced push-up variation where the hands are extra wide and you lower toward each hand in alternating reps. It is more challenging to each working arm than traditional push-ups and also stretches and challenges the chest.
Benefits

    Far more challenging than normal push-ups
    Excellent build-up to single-arm push-ups
    Increased challenge to triceps and chest

    Type: Strength

Isometric Wipers Instructions
Isometric Wipers muscle diagram

    Assume a push-up position, supporting your weight on your hands and toes while keeping your body straight. Your hands should be just outside of shoulder width. This will be your starting position.
    Begin by shifting your body weight as far to one side as possible, allowing the elbow on that side to flex as you lower your body.
    Reverse the motion by extending the flexed arm, pushing yourself up and then dropping to the other side.
    Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

Skating Instructions
Skating muscle diagram

    Roller skating is a fun activity which can be effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular endurance. It requires relatively good balance and coordination. It is necessary to learn the basics of skating including turning and stopping and to wear protective gear to avoid possible injury.
    You can skate at a comfortable pace for 30 minutes straight. If you want a cardio challenge, do interval skating – speed skate two minutes of every five minutes, using the remaining three minutes to recover. A 150 lb person will typically burn about 175 calories in 30 minutes skating at a comfortable pace, similar to brisk walking.

    Chest
    Cable cross-over

Cable cross-over

The cable cross-over is an isolation movement that uses a cable stack to build bigger and stronger pectoral muscles. Since it's done using adjustable pulleys, you can target different parts of your chest by setting the pulleys at different levels. It is common in upper-body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, often as a pre-exhaust at the beginning of a workout or a finishing movement at the end. It is often used in combination with other presses or flyes to target the chest from different angles.
Benefits

    Unlike dumbbells, cables provide constant tension, including at peak contraction
    Can quickly switch weights for dropsets
    Can customize cable height to target specific areas of the chest
    Stretches the chest muscles under load which can lead to greater muscle gain

    Begin by moving the pulleys to the high position, select the resistance to be used, and take a handle in each hand.
    Stand directly between both pulleys with your arms extended out to your sides. Your head and chest should be up while your arms form a “T”. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping the elbows extended, pull your arms straight to your sides.
    Return your arms back to the starting position after a pause at the peak contraction.
    Continue the movement for the prescribed number of repetitions.

    Treadmill running

Treadmill running

Treadmill running is a popular cardiovascular exercise performed on a machine that is available in most gyms. Performing this exercise on a treadmill allows you to adjust the speed of your running and, depending on the machine, perform it on an adjustable incline. Many machines also have built-in heart rate monitors and timers to help you track your progress.
Benefits

    Excellent training for fat-loss and general health
    Excellent way to maintain or improve cardiovascular health
    Less impact than running on pavement outdoors
    Not dependent on weather like running outside

    Type: Cardio

Treadmill running Instructions
Treadmill running muscle diagram

    To begin, step onto the treadmill and select the desired option from the menu. Most treadmills have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.
    Treadmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside. A 150 lb person will burn over 450 calories running 8 miles per hour for 30 minutes. Maintain proper posture as you run, and only hold onto the handles when necessary, such as when dismounting or checking your heart rate.

    Single-arm kettlebell clean and jerk

Single-arm kettlebell clean and jerk

The single-arm kettlebell clean and jerk is a popular kettlebell movement that is performed both in an exercise setting and competitively as a part of Russian-style girevoy sport. It differs from a clean and push-press in that the lifter "dips" under the weight rather than simply using the legs to help push the weight up. Each rep of a clean and jerk is preceded by a clean at the start of each set. It can be trained in traditional strength or muscle-building rep ranges, in circuit or fat-loss training, or as part of a larger kettlebell combination or complex.
Benefits

    Momentum from the legs powers the weight through the toughest part of the press
    Allows you to put more weight overhead than a strict military press or push-press
    Full-body training that challenges the lower body as well as the shoulders, arms, back, and core
    Cleaning the kettlebells to the rack position trains the hips, core, and back muscles
    Serious cardiovascular and conditioning challenge

Single-arm kettlebell clean and jerk Instructions
Single-arm kettlebell clean and jerk muscle diagram

    Hold a kettlebell by the handle.
    Clean the kettlebell to your shoulder by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the kettlebell towards your shoulder. Rotate your wrist as you do so, so that the palm faces forward.
    Dip your body by bending the knees, keeping your torso upright.
    Immediately reverse direction, driving through the heels, in essence jumping to create momentum. As you do so, press the kettlebell overhead to lockout by extending the arms, using your body's momentum to move the weight.
    Receive the weight overhead by returning to a squat position underneath the weight.
    Keeping the weight overhead, return to a standing position. Lower the weight to the floor to perform the next repetition.

Side To Side Chins muscle diagram

    Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using a wide grip.
    As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at a wide grip, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
    Pull your torso up while leaning to the left hand side until the bar almost touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space (no swinging) and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
    After a second of contraction, inhale as you go back to the starting position.
    Now, pull your torso up while leaning to the right hand side until the bar almost touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
    After a second of contraction, inhale as you go back to the starting position.
    Repeat steps 3-6 until you have performed the prescribed amount of repetitions for each side.

Caution: If you are new to this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, using a spotter to hold your legs can help being that it requires putting a lot of stress on the rotator cuffs. Alternatively you can also use a chin assist machine.

Variations: If you have developed enough strength to perform this exercise with weights, do so with caution. Side to side chins can be a challenging exercise and if not performed correctly, can cause injury. Before attempting to use weights, make sure you are able to perform the exercise with good form.

You can also perform the side to side chins by doing all reps to one side and then the next or by also including the middle movement as well (in which case you would pull up first to the left hand side, then the middle and then the right side).

You can use a chin assist machine if you do not have the strength to perform the exercise on your own.

Incline Dumbbell Bench With Palms Facing In Instructions
Incline Dumbbell Bench With Palms Facing In muscle diagram

    Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
    By using your thighs to help you get the dumbbells up, clean the dumbbells one arm at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width.
    Once at shoulder width, keep the palms of your hands with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Keep your elbows flared out with the upper arms in line with the shoulders (perpendicular to the torso) and the elbows bent creating a 90-degree angle between the upper arm and the forearm. This will be your starting position.
    Now bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe in. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times.
    As you breathe out, push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, place the dumbbells back in your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to dispose of the dumbbells.

Variations: You can use several angles on the incline bench if the bench you are using is adjustable. Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing forward (which is the traditional manner). Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.

    Start out by placing two dumbbells on the floor in front of a flat bench.
    Sit down on the edge of the flat bench with your legs at about shoulder width apart. Make sure to keep your feet on the floor.
    Use your arms to grab both of the dumbbells and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against your thighs with the palms of the hands facing down. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge of your thighs.
    Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling.
    Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling. Make sure to inhale during this part of the exercise. Tip: Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    When finished, simply lower the dumbbells to the floor.

Variations:

    This exercise can also be performed using a barbell instead of a dumbbell.
    You can also focus on one arm at a time to isolate the forearms.

    Clock push-up

Clock push-up

The clock push-up is a series of regular push-ups performed one at a time, moving your hands one step to the side between each one until you've completed a full circle. It targets the same muscles as traditional push-ups, such as the chest, triceps, and shoulders, but adds an endurance and core challenge to traditional push-ups.
Benefits

    Strengthens the chest, triceps, shoulders, and abdominals
    Increases core strength and hip stability
    Engages lower-body muscles to maintain plank position

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Chest
    Equipment: Body Only

Clock push-up Instructions
Clock push-up muscle diagram

    Move into a prone position on the floor, supporting your weight on your hands and toes.
    Your arms should be fully extended with the hands around shoulder width. Keep your body straight throughout the movement. This will be your starting position.
    Descend by flexing at the elbow, lowering your chest toward the ground.
    At the bottom, reverse the motion by pushing yourself up through elbow extension as quickly as possible until you are air borne. Aim to “jump” 12-18 inches to one side.
    As you accelerate up, move your outside foot away from your direction of travel. Leaving the ground, shift your body about 30 degrees for the next repetition.
    Return to the starting position and repeat the exercise, working all the way around until you are back where you started.

    Machine seated row

Machine seated row

The machine seated row is a popular exercise targeting the back muscles, particularly the lats (latissimus dorsi), rhomboids, and middle and lower trapezius. There is a wide variety of seated row machines, but most of them approximate the motion of a free-weight row, but in an upright, forward-facing position. Machine row variations are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or back-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, middle and lower traps, and biceps
    Can go heavier than most free-weight row variations
    Machines often have different grip options to choose from
    Easy to change weight for dropsets

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Lats
    Equipment: Machine
    Level: Beginner

    Load an appropriate weight onto the pins and adjust the seat height so that the handles are at chest level. Grasp the handles with either a neutral or pronated grip. This will be your starting position.
    Pull the handles towards your torso, retracting your shoulder blades as you flex the elbow.
    Pause at the bottom of the motion, and then slowly return the handles to the starting position. For multiple repetitions, avoid completely returning the weight to the stops to keep tension on the muscles being worked.

    Lie face up with your whole body straight on a flat bench while holding a weight plate on top of your forehead. Tip: You will need to position yourself so that your shoulders are slightly above the end of a flat bench in order for the traps, neck and head to be off the bench. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping the plate secure on your forehead slowly lower your head back in a semi-circular motion as you breathe in.
    Raise your head back up to the starting position in a semi-circular motion as you breathe out. Hold the contraction for a second.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: As with all exercises, refrain from using any sort of sudden or jerking motions.

Variation: You can opt to use no resistance at first.

    Quadriceps
    Weighted sissy squat

Weighted sissy squat

The weighted sissy squat is an exercise primarily targeting the quadriceps. In sissy squats, the knees travel over the toes, placing the quads under a fairly extreme stretch. They are usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of a lower-body training session.
Benefits

    Builds and strengthens the quadriceps
    Holding onto a support decreases balance challenge
    Simple way to progress from bodyweight sissy squats

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps
    Equipment: Other

Weighted sissy squat Instructions
Weighted sissy squat muscle diagram

    Standing upright, with feet at shoulder width and toes raised, use one hand to hold onto the beams of a squat rack and the opposite arm to hold a plate on top of your chest. This is your starting position.
    As you use one arm to hold yourself, bend at the knees and slowly lower your torso toward the ground by bringing your pelvis and knees forward. Inhale as you go down and stop when your upper and lower legs almost create a 90-degree angle. Hold the stretch position for a second.
    After your one second hold, use your thigh muscles to bring your torso back up to the starting position. Exhale as you move up.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of times.

Caution: This exercise is to be avoided if you suffer from knee problems as it can stress the knee. Also, make sure that there is nothing behind you; as in the case that you lose your balance and fall, that way nothing will hit you on the head causing an injury.

Variations: If you are new to this exercise, you can start by using two arms (so you'll need the two beams of the squat rack in front of you to hold yourself). As you become more advanced then just use one arm. Once that becomes easy, you can use the opposite arm to hold a plate on top of your chest.

Dumbbell Raise Instructions
Dumbbell Raise muscle diagram

    Grab a dumbbell in each arm and stand up straight with your arms extended by your sides with a slight bend at the elbows and your back straight. This will be your starting position. Tip: The dumbbell should be next to your thighs with the palm of your hands facing back.
    Use your side shoulders to lift the dumbbells as you exhale. The dumbbells should be to the side of the body as you move them up. Continue to lift it until the dumbbells are nearly in line with your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbell, your elbow should always be higher than your forearm. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.
    Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from this movement and substitute by some form of lateral raises.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using an e-z bar, cables and exercise band.

    Start out by placing two dumbbells on one side of a flat bench.
    Kneel down on both of your knees so that your body is facing the flat bench.
    Use your arms to grab both of the dumbbells with a pronated grip (palms facing down) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the flat bench. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge.
    Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling.
    Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can also be performed sitting down by using your thighs as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over your knees and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed.
    You can also use a barbell instead of a dumbbell.

One Arm Supinated Dumbbell Triceps Extension muscle diagram

    Lie flat on a bench while holding a dumbbell at arms length. Your arm should be perpendicular to your body. The palm of your hand should be facing towards your face as a supinated grip is required to perform this exercise.
    Place your non lifting hand on your bicep for support.
    Slowly begin to lower the dumbbell down as you breathe in.
    Then, begin lifting the dumbbell upward as you contract the triceps. Remember to breathe out during the concentric (lifting part of the exercise).
    Repeat until you have performed your set repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the movement.
    Switch arms again and repeat the movement.

Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbell next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.

Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrist so that you can place the dumbbell on top of your thigh. When the dumbbell is touching your thigh simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbell on your thigh) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbell on top of the thigh). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with the dumbbell still on top of your thigh. At this moment you can place the dumbbell on the floor.

    Quadriceps
    Stationary bike

Stationary bike

The stationary bike is a popular cardio machine found in most commercial gyms. Along with burning a ton of calories, the stationary bike also helps develop the lower body. Stationary bikes come in multiple variations, ranging from ones that resemble riding a bike, to recumbent bikes, to fan bikes that work both the arms and the legs. No matter the variation, a stationary bike can work well at higher speeds for interval-style conditioning training, but also works well at slower paces for steady-state cardio.
Benefits

    Burns a lot of calories
    Easier on the joints than running
    Great cardiovascular conditioning
    Equally effective at HIIT and moderate-intensity cardio

    Type: Cardio
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps

Stationary bike Instructions
Stationary bike muscle diagram

    To begin, seat yourself on the bike and adjust the seat to your height.
    Select the desired option from the menu. You may have to start pedaling to turn it on. You can use the manual setting, or you can select a program to use. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. The level of resistance can be changed throughout the workout. The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity.

Stationary bikes offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and have less impact than other activities. A 150 lb person will burn about 230 calories cycling at a moderate rate for 30 minutes, compared to 450 calories or more running.

    Dumbbell bent-over row

Dumbbell bent-over row

The dumbbell bent-over row is a popular exercise to develop and strengthen the muscles of the upper and middle back, like the latissimus (lat), lower trapezius, and rear deltoids. It can work equally well in strength, muscle-building, or circuit-style fat-loss workouts.
Benefits

    Forces the core muscles to stabilize while the upper body is moving
    Trains back and grip strength, as well as hips and glutes from holding the bent-over position
    Boosts the heart rate and creates a cardiovascular challenge during strength training

Dumbbell bent-over row Instructions
Dumbbell bent-over row muscle diagram

    With a dumbbell in each hand (palms facing your torso), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward by bending at the waist; as you bend make sure to keep your back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The weights should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.
    While keeping the torso stationary, lift the dumbbells to your side (as you breathe out), keeping the elbows close to the body (do not exert any force with the forearm other than holding the weights). On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.
    Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution:

    This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.
    Ensure perfect form and never round the back as this can promote back injury.
    Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a low pulley instead with a v-bar or with a barbell. This exercise can also be performed with supinated or neutral grips.

    Barbell thruster

Barbell thruster

The barbell thruster is a full-body exercise that incorporates both squatting and pressing in one functional movement. It's especially common in contemporary CrossFit workouts, but also in general strength training. The barbell is usually cleaned into place first, but it could be performed taken from a squat rack in a front-rack position. The thruster can be performed in traditional strength-focused rep ranges to build strength in the press, or in higher reps for full-body conditioning.
Benefits

    Front squat develops quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core strength
    Overhead press works shoulders, triceps, and upper back
    Can be a strength move or a metcon, depending on rep range
    Squat helps push through the sticking point of the press

    Type: Strength

Barbell thruster Instructions
Barbell thruster muscle diagram

    Set the bar in a rack slightly below shoulder level so that when under it, your knees are slightly bent. Rest the bar on top of the front deltoids, pushing into the clavicles, and lightly touching the throat. Your hands should be in a clean grip, touching the bar only with your fingers to help keep it in position.
    To unrack the bar, push upward into it and push your hips forward. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head and elbows up at all times. Your triceps should remain parallel with the ground. Keep a neutral neck and flat back. This will be your starting position.
    Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt back. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    As you prepare to ascend, push through your heels and begin to wrap your fingers tightly around the bar for a firm grip. As you near the top of your squat, begin pressing the bar up towards the ceiling, allowing your neck to hyperextend so that the bar has room to move.
    A final position will be one in which your arms are fully extended overhead and your legs straight. Maintain tightness from head to toe.
    Lower the bar slowly, allowing your knees to bend to lessen the blow. Immediately transition back into the squatting movement to continue into the next repetition. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.

    On a flat bench lie facedown with the hips on the edge of the bench, the legs straight with toes high off the floor and with the arms on top of the bench holding on to the front edge.
    Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings and straighten the legs until they are level with the hips. This will be your starting position.
    Start the movement by lifting the left leg higher than the right leg.
    Then lower the left leg as you lift the right leg.
    Continue alternating in this manner (as though you are doing a flutter kick in water) until you have done the recommended amount of repetitions for each leg. Make sure that you keep a controlled movement at all times. Tip: You will breathe normally as you perform this movement.

Variations: As you get more advanced you can use ankle weights.

    Dumbbell sumo squat

Dumbbell sumo squat

The dumbbell sumo squat is a popular lower-body movement using a single dumbbell held in front of the legs. It is performed with a wider than shoulder-width stance, which increases the demand on the glutes, hamstrings, and adductors while still benefiting the quads, core, and upper body. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of the lower-body portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Great for building the glutes and hamstrings, even with relatively light weights
    Encourages mobility and flexibility of the hips and adductors
    Encourages squatting with good form and an upright torso

    Type: Strength

    Hold a dumbbell at the base with both hands and stand straight up. Move your legs so that they are wider than shoulder width apart from each other with your knees slightly bent.
    Your toes should be facing out. Note: Your arms should be stationary while performing the exercise. This is the starting position.
    Slowly bend the knees and lower your legs until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Make sure to inhale as this is the eccentric part of the exercise.
    Press mainly with the heel of the foot to bring the body back to the starting position while exhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Failure to keep your back straight can result in back injury.

    Barbell upright row

Barbell upright row

The barbell upright row is a barbell exercise that builds stronger and bigger traps. Many lifters combine this move with either their back or shoulder workout since it involves both body parts.
Benefits

    Builds the traps and rear and medial deltoids
    Can adjust grip width for comfort and to avoid shoulder pain
    Can help improve cleans and snatches

Barbell upright row Instructions
Barbell upright row muscle diagram

    Grasp a barbell with an overhand grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The bar should be resting on the top of your thighs with your arms extended and a slight bend in your elbows. Your back should also be straight. This will be your starting position.
    Now exhale and use the sides of your shoulders to lift the bar, raising your elbows up and to the side. Keep the bar close to your body as you raise it. Continue to lift the bar until it nearly touches your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion, and should always be higher than your forearms. Remember to keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.
    Lower the bar back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using dumbbells, though this later exercise should be reserved by people that are well familiarized with correct execution.

    Straight-Arm Pulldown

Straight-Arm Pulldown

The straight-arm bar pull-down is a variation of the straight-arm lat pull-down performed using a cable stack machine. It can either be performed in an athletic upright stance, or slightly bent-over. It both stretches and contracts the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi) as well as providing additional activation to the other upper back muscles and the core. Because the triceps are also isometrically involved in the movement, it is usually performed for higher reps, like 8-15 reps or above.
Benefits

    Strengthens the muscles of the lats, upper back, and core
    Easy to alter grip width to provide variety or �feel� the movement working better
    Effective alternative to pull-overs, especially for people with limited overhead shoulder mobility
    Constant tension throughout movement, and multiple choices of handles

Straight-Arm Pulldown Instructions
Straight-Arm Pulldown muscle diagram

    You will start by grabbing the wide bar from the top pulley of a pulldown machine and using a wider than shoulder-width pronated (palms down) grip. Step backwards two feet or so.
    Bend your torso forward at the waist by around 30-degrees with your arms fully extended in front of you and a slight bend at the elbows. If your arms are not fully extended then you need to step a bit more backwards until they are. Once your arms are fully extended and your torso is slightly bent at the waist, tighten the lats and then you are ready to begin.
    While keeping the arms straight, pull the bar down by contracting the lats until your hands are next to the side of the thighs. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    While keeping the arms straight, go back to the starting position while breathing in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: Can also be performed with a shorter shoulder-width straight bar or with a rope attachment.

Barbell stiff-legged deadlift

The barbell stiff-legged deadlift targets the hamstrings, glutes, lower and upper back, as well as the core. It is a popular accessory movement for the deadlift, but also a muscle-building hamstring movement.
Benefits

    Stretches and engages the hamstrings and lower back to a greater degree than a bent knee position
    Also works the calves, quads, and forearms indirectly
    The barbell variation allows for heavier loading than with dumbbells
    Can use straps if grip is a limitation

    Grasp a bar using an overhand grip (palms facing down). You may need some wrist wraps if using a significant amount of weight.
    Stand with your torso straight and your legs spaced using a shoulder width or narrower stance. The knees should be slightly bent. This is your starting position.
    Keeping the knees stationary, lower the barbell to over the top of your feet by bending at the waist while keeping your back straight. Keep moving forward as if you were going to pick something from the floor until you feel a stretch on the hamstrings. Inhale as you perform this movement.
    Start bringing your torso up straight again by extending your hips until you are back at the starting position. Exhale as you perform this movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is not an exercise that is recommended for people with lower back problems. Also, it needs to be treated with the utmost respect paying special attention not to round the back forward as you move the torso down; the back should always be straight. Finally, jerking motions or doing too much weight can injure your back.

Variations: The exercise can also be performed with a dumbbell as described above.

    To begin, stand up with a dumbbell held in one hand. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart from each other. Now fully extend the arm with the dumbbell over your head. Tip: The small finger of your hand should be facing the ceiling and the palm of your hand should be facing forward. The dumbbell should be above your head.
    This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your upper arm close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearm touch your bicep. Tip: The upper arm should remain stationary and only the forearm should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.
    Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the exercise.

Variation: You can perform this exercise with a rope attached to a low pulley.

    Smith machine bench press

Smith machine bench press

The Smith machine bench press is a machine-based movement targeting the chest. The Smith machine mimics a barbell but provides more stability. This movement can be programmed in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle and strength endurance. It is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a chest or upper-body focused workout.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the chest and triceps
    Many lifters find they feel the movement more in their chest and less in their shoulders than the traditional bench press
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to control

Smith machine bench press Instructions
Smith machine bench press muscle diagram

    Place a flat bench underneath the smith machine. Now place the barbell at a height that you can reach when lying down and your arms are almost fully extended. Once the weight you need is selected, lie down on the flat bench. Using a pronated grip that is wider than shoulder width, unlock the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest.
    After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, lock the bar back in the rack.

Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.

Same as the Barbell Bench Press but with a Smith Machine.

    Pick a couple of dumbbells and sit at the end of a flat bench with your feet firmly on the floor. Hold the dumbbells with your palms facing in and your arms straight down at your sides at arms' length. This will be your starting position.

Continue to go up until you arms are parallel to the floor. Exhale as you execute this movement and pause for a second at the top.
    Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Dumbbell Lying Rear Lateral Raise

Dumbbell Lying Rear Lateral Raise

The incline dumbbell reverse fly is an upper-body exercise targeting the posterior or rear deltoids, as well as the postural muscles of the upper back. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the posterior deltoids
    The incline takes away the potential of using momentum, making the movement more challenging
    Helps develop bigger, more balanced, and healthier shoulders
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day
    Works the rhomboids and lower and middle traps

    Type: Strength

    While holding a dumbbell in each hand, lay with your chest down on a slightly inclined (around 15 degrees when measured from the floor) adjustable bench.
    Position the palms of the hands in a neutral manner (palms facing your torso) as you keep the arms extended with the elbows slightly bent. This will be your starting position.
    Now raise the arms to the side until your elbows are at shoulder height and your arms are roughly parallel to the floor as you exhale. Tip: Maintain your arms perpendicular to the torso while keeping them extended throughout the movement. Also, keep the contraction at the top for a second.
    Slowly lower the dumbbells to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then switch to the other arm.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with just one arm and also keeping the palms of the hands facing back as opposed to facing your torso.

Benefits

    Builds the biceps peak
    The preacher bench enforces strict form, making the biceps work harder
    Biceps have to work independently, making each one work harder

    Grab a dumbbell with each arm and place the upper arms on top of the preacher bench or the incline bench. The dumbbell should be held at shoulder length. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, slowly lower the dumbbells until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched.
    As you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weights up until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder height.
    Squeeze the biceps hard for a second at the contracted position and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise also using a low pulley instead of a dumbbell. In this case you will need to position the bench in front of the pulley. You can also use a barbell or an e-z bar.

    Quadriceps
    Dumbbell seated box jump

Dumbbell seated box jump

The dumbbell seated box jump is an explosive exercise that builds the quadriceps as well as overall lower-body strength and explosiveness. All you need is a box, a bench, and a light dumbbell. Performing it from a seated position eliminates the stretch reflex in the lower body, forcing you to generate more power. This is an advanced move, so consider starting off with box jumps or squat jumps before progressing to this.
Benefits

    Builds and strengthens the lower body
    Builds serious full-body explosive power
    Excellent contrast movement with heavy squats or deadlifts

    Type: Plyometrics
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps
    Equipment: Dumbbell

    Plant your feet firmly on the ground as you lean forward, extending through the hips and knees to jump up and forward.
    Land on the box with both feet, absorbing the impact by allowing the hips and knees to bend.
    Step down and return to the starting position.

    Lie facedown on an incline bench while holding a dumbbell in each hand. Your arms should be fully extended hanging down and pointing towards the floor. The palms of your hands should be facing each other. This will be your starting position.
    As you exhale, squeeze your shoulder blades together and hold the contraction for a full second. Tip: This movement is just like the reverse action of a hug, or trying to perform rear laterals as if you had no arms.
    As you inhale go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Incline face-down bar front raise

Incline face-down bar front raise

The incline face-down bar front raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the shoulders. Because it is performed face down on an angled bench, it has a greater range of motion than standing or upright-seated raises and hits the shoulders from a different angle. Raise variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or shoulder-focused training.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the anterior and medial deltoids
    Performing on a bench enforces strict form and eliminates momentum
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Shoulders

    Begin a pushup position but with your elbows on the ground and resting on your forearms. Your arms should be bent at a 90 degree angle.
    Arch your back slightly out rather than keeping your back completely straight.
    Raise your glutes toward the ceiling, squeezing your abs tightly to close the distance between your ribcage and hips. The end result will be that you’ll end up in a high bridge position. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Lower back down slowly to your starting position as you breathe in. Tip: Don't let your back sag downwards.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Bodyweight Reverse Lunge Instructions
Bodyweight Reverse Lunge muscle diagram

    Begin in a standing position. Your hands should be on your hips or hanging at your sides. Look directly forward, keeping your chest up, with your feet shoulder-width apart. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by taking a step to the rear, allowing your hips and knees to flex to lower your body. Contacting the back leg through only the ball of the foot, descend until your knee nearly touches the ground. Use a slow and controlled motion, paying special attention to proper mechanics and posture. The knee should stay in line with the foot, and the thoracic spine should remain neutral.
    After a brief pause, return to the starting position by driving through the heel of the front leg to extend the knees and hips.
    This movement can be done completely on one side before switching, or can be performed in an alternating fashion.

Seated One-Arm Dumbbell Palms-Down Wrist Curl muscle diagram

    Sit on a flat bench with a dumbbell in your right hand.
    Place your feet flat on the floor, at a distance that is slightly wider than shoulder width apart.
    Lean forward and place your right forearm on top of your upper right thigh with your palm down. Tip: Make sure that the back of the wrist lies on top of your knees. This will be your starting position.
    Lower the dumbbell as far as possible as you keep a tight grip on the dumbbell. Inhale as you perform this movement.
    Now curl the dumbbell as high as possible as you contract the forearms and as you exhale. Keep the contraction for a second before you lower again. Tip: The only movement should happen at the wrist.
    Perform for the recommended amount of repetitions, switch arms and repeat the movement.

Variations: You can also do this movement with two arms at a time, one on each knee, or using a barbell.

Glute Kickback Instructions
Glute Kickback muscle diagram

    Kneel on the floor or an exercise mat and bend at the waist with your arms extended in front of you (perpendicular to the torso) in order to get into a kneeling push-up position but with the arms spaced at shoulder width. Your head should be looking forward and the bend of the knees should create a 90-degree angle between the hamstrings and the calves. This will be your starting position.
    As you exhale, lift up your right leg until the hamstrings are in line with the back while maintaining the 90-degree angle bend. Contract the glutes throughout this movement and hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: At the end of the movement the upper leg should be parallel to the floor while the calf should be perpendicular to it.
    Go back to the initial position as you inhale and now repeat with the left leg.
    Continue to alternate legs until all of the recommended repetitions have been performed.

Variations: For this exercise you can also perform all of the repetitions with one leg first and then the other one. Additionally, you can also add ankle weights.

    Quadriceps
    Treadmill jogging

Treadmill jogging

Treadmill jogging is a popular cardiovascular exercise performed on a machine that is available in most gyms. Performing this exercise on a treadmill allows you to adjust the speed of your jogging and, depending on the machine, perform it on an adjustable incline. Many machines also have built-in heart rate monitors and timers to help you track your progress.
Benefits

    Excellent training for fat-loss and general health
    Excellent way to maintain or improve cardiovascular health
    Less impact than jogging on pavement outdoors
    Not dependent on weather like jogging outside

    Type: Cardio
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps

Treadmill jogging Instructions
Treadmill jogging muscle diagram

    To begin, step onto the treadmill and select the desired option from the menu. Most treadmills have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.
    Treadmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than jogging outside. A 150 lb person will burn almost 250 calories jogging for 30 minutes, compared to more than 450 calories running. Maintain proper posture as you jog, and only hold onto the handles when necessary, such as when dismounting or checking your heart rate.

    Grab two wide-rimmed plates and put them together with the smooth sides facing outward
    Use your fingers to grip the outside part of the plate and your thumb for the other side thus holding both plates together. This is the starting position.
    Squeeze the plate with your fingers and thumb. Hold this position for as long as you can.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of sets prescribed in your program.
    Switch arms and repeat the movements.

Caution: Attempting to hold the weighted plate for too long can cause you to drop the plate. As a result, it may land on your feet or other areas which may cause an injury. So if you feel like the weight is about to slip out of your hand, slowly bend your knees while keeping your back straight and put the plates on the floor.

    Triceps
    Reverse-grip bench press

Reverse-grip bench press

The reverse-grip bench press is a popular barbell exercise targeting the chest, triceps, and forearms. The main difference between this exercise and the standard bench press is that the grip is underhand, not overhand. This helps target both the upper chest and the triceps. This lift can feel awkward at first, so go light and don't be afraid to use a spotter.
Benefits

    Targets the triceps more than the standard bench press
    Emphasizes the upper chest
    Some lifters find it easier on the shoulders than overhand bench variations

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Triceps

Reverse-grip bench press Instructions
Reverse-grip bench press muscle diagram

    Lie back on a flat bench. Using a close, supinated grip (around shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked extended in front of you and perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that as opposed to a regular bench press, you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement.
    After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.

Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall around the area between the sternum and upper abs.

Variation: This exercise can also be performed with an e-z bar using the inner handle as well as dumbbells.

    Adjust the leader chain, shortening it to the desired length.Place the chains on the sleeves of the bar.
    Lying on the bench, get your head beyond the bar if possible. Tuck your feet underneath you and arch your back. Using the bar to help support your weight, lift your shoulder off the bench and retract them, squeezing the shoulder blades together. Use your feet to drive your traps into the bench. Maintain this tight body position throughout the movement. However wide your grip, it should cover the ring on the bar.
    Pull the bar out of the rack without protracting your shoulders. Focus on squeezing the bar and trying to pull it apart. Lower the bar to your lower chest or upper stomach. The bar, wrist, and elbow should stay in line at all times.
    Pause when the barbell touches your torso, and then drive the bar up with as much force as possible. The elbows should be tucked in until lockout.

    Bench barbell roll-out

Bench barbell roll-out

The bench barbell roll-out is a challenging exercise targeting the abdominals. It is similar to using an ab roller, but using a barbell allows for a wider grip. Placing the knees on a bench rather than the floor makes the move more difficult by increasing the challenge to the upper body.
Benefits

    Works the ab muscles, including the deep core and the rectus abdominis or "six-pack" muscles
    Also hammers the upper back and lats
    Can be the only core movement you need in a workout

    Place a loaded barbell on the ground, near the end of a bench. Kneel with both legs on the bench, and take a medium to narrow grip on the barbell. This will be your starting position.
    To begin, extend through the hips to slowly roll the bar forward. As you roll out, flex the shoulder to roll the bar above your head. Ensure that your arms remain extended throughout the movement.
    When the bar has been moved as far forward as possible, return to the starting position.

Incline Push-Up Depth Jump Instructions
Incline Push-Up Depth Jump muscle diagram

    For this drill you will need a box about 12 inches high, and two thick mats or aerobics steps.
    Place the steps just outside of your shoulders, and place your feet on top of the box so that you are in an incline pushup position, your hands just inside the steps. This will be your starting position.
    Begin by bending at the elbows to lower your body, quickly reversing position to push your body off of the ground. As you leave the ground, move your hands onto the steps, bending your elbows to absorb the impact.
    Repeat the motion to return to the starting position.

    Push-Up Wide

Push-Up Wide

The wide push-up is a variation of the push-up with the hands wider than shoulder-width apart. It targets upper-body muscle groups including the chest, shoulders, and triceps, but has more of a chest emphasis than narrower-grip push-up variations. If wide push-ups lead to pain in the front of your shoulder, opt for a narrower version.
Benefits

    Greater chest stretch and emphasis than narrower push-up variations
    Strengthens the chest, triceps, upper back, and shoulders
    Can be more difficult than narrower push-ups, depending on depth

    Type: Strength

    With your hands wide apart, support your body on your toes and hands in a plank position. Your elbows should be extended and your body straight. Do not allow your hips to sag. This will be your starting position.
    To begin, allow the elbows to flex, lowering your chest to the floor as you inhale.
    Using your pectoral muscles, press your upper body back up to the starting position by extending the elbows. Exhale as you perform this step.
    After pausing at the contracted position, repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

    Barbell behind-the-back shrug

Barbell behind-the-back shrug

The barbell behind-the-back shrug is an exercise targeting the traps. Having the bar behind you helps keep your shoulders pulled up and back, rather than rounded forward. It is popular in strength and muscle-focused upper-body training, and is often trained on a shoulder day. With the assistance of straps, it can be loaded heavily, but it is still usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-10 reps per set.
Benefits

    Hits upper and mid traps more, but limits the weight used
    Works the shoulders and upper-back muscles secondarily
    Can increase difficulty by adding a pause at the top

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Traps
    Equipment: Barbell

Barbell behind-the-back shrug muscle diagram

    Stand up straight with your feet at shoulder width as you hold a barbell with both hands behind your back using a pronated grip (palms facing back). Tip: Your hands should be a little wider than shoulder width apart. You can use wrist wraps for this exercise for better grip. This will be your starting position.
    Raise your shoulders up as far as you can go as you breathe out and hold the contraction for a second. Tip: Refrain from trying to lift the barbell by using your biceps. The arms should remain stretched out at all times.
    Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also rotate your shoulders as you go up, going in a semicircular motion from rear to front. However this version is not good for people with shoulder problems. In addition, this exercise can be performed with the barbell in front of your thighs, with dumbbells by the side, a smith machine or with a shrug machine.

    Lie down on a flat bench face up while holding a dumbbell in each arm on top of your thighs.
    Bring the dumbbells to the sides with the arms extended and the palms of the hands facing your thighs (neutral grip).
    While keeping the arms close to your torso and elbows in, slowly lower your arms (as you keep them extended with a slight bend at the elbows) as far down towards the floor as you can go. Once you cannot go down any further, lock your upper arms in that position and that will be your starting position.
    As you breathe out, slowly begin to curl the weights up as you simultaneously rotate your wrists so that the palms of the hands face up. Continue curling the weight until your biceps are fully contracted and squeeze hard at the top position for a second. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Upper arms should remain stationary and elbows should stay in throughout the movement.
    Return back to the starting position very slowly.

Caution: It is very important to use a weight that you can control throughout the movement and also to start with a slight bend in your elbows. It is very easy to injure the biceps tendon if improper form and or too much weight is used.

    Choke the band around a post. The band should be at the same height as your elbow. Stand with your right side to the band a couple of feet away.
    Grasp the end of the band with your right hand, and keep your elbow pressed firmly to your side. We recommend you hold a pad or foam roll in place with your elbow to keep it firmly in position.
    With your upper arm in position, your elbow should be flexed to 90 degrees with your hand reaching away from your torso. This will be your starting position.
    Execute the movement by rotating your arm in a forehand motion, keeping your elbow in place.
    Continue as far as you are able, pause, and then return to the starting position.

    Lower the handles slowly back to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Single-arm kneeling lat pull-down

Single-arm kneeling lat pull-down

The single-arm kneeling lat pull-down is a variation of the lat pull-down exercise performed one arm at a time, with the knees on the ground, rather than sitting on a bench or machine. It has all of the same benefits of a lat pull-down performed on a bench or machine, in addition to providing further activation to the core and lower body.
Benefits

    Strengthens the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), upper back, and biceps
    Working the back one side at a time allows you to focus on balance between sides and feel the proper muscles contracting
    Activates and strengthens the glutes and core more than standard lat pull-downs
    Cable provides constant tension throughout the movement and multiple choices of handles
    Can be performed at any cable station if a lat pull-down machine is unavailable

    Attach a single handle to a high pulley and make your weight selection.
    Kneel in front of the cable tower, taking the cable with one hand with your arm extended. This will be your starting position.
    Starting with your palm facing forward, pull the weight down to your torso by flexing the elbow and retract the shoulder blade. As you do so, rotate the wrist so that at the completion of the movement, your palm is now facing you.
    After a brief pause, return to the starting position.

    Adjust the j-hooks so they are at the appropriate height to rack the bar. Begin lying on the floor with your head near the end of a power rack. Keeping your shoulder blades pulled together; pull the bar off of the hooks.
    Lower the bar towards the bottom of your chest or upper stomach, squeezing the bar and attempting to pull it apart as you do so. Ensure that you tuck your elbows throughout the movement. Lower the bar until your upper arm contacts the ground and pause, preventing any slamming or bouncing of the weight.
    Press the bar back up as fast as you can, keeping the bar, your wrists, and elbows in line as you do so.

    Feet-elevated oblique crunch

Feet-elevated oblique crunch

The feet-elevated oblique crunch is a variation on the crunch exercise that targets the obliques as well as the rectus abdominis or "six-pack" muscles. Resting the feet on a bench takes some of the hip flexor activation out of the movement, focusing the stress more on the abs.
Benefits

    Elevating your feet forces your abs and obliques to handle a greater percentage of the load
    Can be performed using a couch or any other elevated surface
    Great for isolating the obliques

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Abdominals
    Equipment: Body Only

Feet-elevated oblique crunch Instructions
Feet-elevated oblique crunch muscle diagram

    Lie flat on the floor with your lower back pressed to the ground. For this exercise, you will need to put one hand beside your head and the other to the side against the floor.
    Make sure your feet are elevated and resting on a flat surface.
    Now lift the shoulder in which your hand is touching your head.
    Simply elevate your shoulder and body upward until you touch your knee. For example, if you have your right hand besides your head, then you want to elevate your body upwards until your right elbow touches your left knee. The same variation can be applied doing the inverse and using your left elbow to touch your right knee.
    After your knee touches your elbow, lower your body until you have reached the starting position.
    Remember to breathe in during the eccentric (lowering) part of the exercise and to breathe out during the concentric (upward) part of the exercise.
    Continue alternating in this manner until all of the recommended repetitions for each side have been completed.

Note: While you cannot add resistance to this exercise you can concentrate on perfect execution and slow speed.

    Elevated Cable Rows

Elevated Cable Rows

The cable seated row is a popular exercise to train the muscles of the upper back, including the lats (latissimus dorsi), traps, rhomboids, and rear deltoids, using a cable stack. It also targets the biceps to a lesser degree. The cable row can work well in a variety of rep-ranges, but is most popular in muscle-building workouts or as an accessory movement for strength workouts.
Benefits

    Constant tension throughout the movement, including at peak contraction
    Equipment common in commercial gyms
    Easy to quickly switch weights for dropsets or utilize lifting straps to lift heavier
    Can use a variety of handles and grip widths to target different parts of the back

    Type: Strength

Elevated Cable Rows Instructions
Elevated Cable Rows muscle diagram

    Get a platform of some sort (it can be an aerobics or calf raise platform) that is around 4-6 inches in height.
    Place it on the seat of the cable row machine.
    Sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.
    Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.
    With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise.
    Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Avoid swinging your torso back and forth as you can cause lower back injury by doing so.

Variations: You can use a straight bar instead of a V-Bar and perform with a pronated grip (palms facing down-forward) or a supinated grip (palms facing up-reverse grip).

    Hold a dumbbell in each hand and lie on an incline bench that is set to an incline angle of no more than 30 degrees.
    Extend your arms above you with a slight bend at the elbows.
    Now rotate the wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing you. Tip: The pinky fingers should be next to each other. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, start to slowly lower the arms to the side while keeping the arms extended and while rotating the wrists until the palms of the hand are facing each other. Tip: At the end of the movement the arms will be by your side with the palms facing the ceiling.
    As you exhale start to bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position by reversing the motion and rotating the hands so that the pinky fingers are next to each other again. Tip: Keep in mind that the movement will only happen at the shoulder joint and at the wrist. There is no motion that happens at the elbow joint.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform regular flyes and also twisting flyes where your initial position starts with the thumbs facing each other instead of the pinky.

    While keeping your arms straight, bring them across your chest in a semicircular motion to the front as you exhale and flex your pecs. Hold the contraction for a second.
    Slowly return to the starting position as you inhale.
    Perform for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Dumbbell iron cross squat

Dumbbell iron cross squat

The dumbbell iron cross squat is a movement that combines a dumbbell squat with a dumbbell lateral raise. At the bottom of the movement, you hold the dumbbells in front of your body, providing a counterweight that allows you to squat more deeply. Then, at the top, you raise those weights out to the side to target the medial heads of the shoulders. Because the lateral raise is the limiting factor, this movement is usually performed for high reps in an athleticism or fat-loss focused workout.
Benefits

    Adds an upper-body element to a lower-body move
    Holding light dumbbells in front of the body improves squat depth and technique
    Great full-body movement for circuit training

    Type: Strength

Dumbbell iron cross squat Instructions
Dumbbell iron cross squat muscle diagram

1. Stand with feet shoulder width apart holding a dumbbell in each hand.

2. Now lift the arms to your sides so that your torso and the arms form the letter "T". The arms should be parallel to the floor and perpendicular to each side of your torso. The palms should be facing forward. This will be your starting position.

3-a. As you inhale slowly squat down by bending at the knees and holding the back erect as if you were going to sit on a chair. Continue with the squat motion until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Tip: Remember that the knees should never go past your toes.

3-b. As you squat down, simultaneously bring the arms in front of you until the palms of the hands are facing each other. Tip: This will look like a flat bench flye but performed standing up. The arms will remain extended throughout the movement and only the shoulder joint will move.

4. Now start pressing with the ball of the foot mainly in order to go back to the initial position and simultaneously move the arms out away from your sides in order to form a giant "T" as you stand upright. Exhale as you perform this movement.

5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Split Jerk muscle diagram

    Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward.
    Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible. Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders. At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible.
    In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athlete’s effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be moved to a split stance, one foot forward, one foot back, with the knees partially bent. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead.
    Return to a standing position, bringing the feet together.

    Standing Low-Pulley Deltoid Raise

Standing Low-Pulley Deltoid Raise

The single-arm cable lateral raise is an isolation exercise targeting the shoulders, specifically the medial deltoid. This movement also hits the traps and upper back, and allows you to focus on each side independently. Because grip is a limitation, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, like at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper body or shoulders-focused workout.
Benefits

    Build and strengthen the deltoids, and middle deltoids in particular
    Cable encourages strict form without excess momentum
    Cable keeps constant tension on the muscles

    Start by standing to the right side of a low pulley row. Use your left hand to come across the body and grab a single handle attached to the low pulley with a pronated grip (palms facing down). Rest your arm in front of you. Your right hand should grab the machine for better support and balance.
    Make sure that your back is erect and your feet are shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position.
    Begin to use the left hand and come across your body out until it is elevated to shoulder height while exhaling.
    Feel the contraction at the top for a second and begin to slowly lower the handle back down to the original starting position while inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the exercise.

    Rack pull

Rack pull

The rack pull is a variation of the deadlift performed from an elevated height, either using boxes, safety pins, or the safeties in a squat rack. It targets all the same muscles as the deadlift, including the glutes, hamstrings, upper back, lower back, and grip. It can be used to strengthen deadlift lockout, but also as a deadlift alternative for people who can't deadlift from the floor without pain.
Benefits

    Builds strength and size similar to a deadlift
    Can load heavier than a deadlift from the floor
    May be safer for elderly people and beginners than deadlifts from the floor
    Can be performed at multiple different levels, such as below the knee, above the knee, or just a few inches from lockout

    Type: Powerlifting

Rack pull Instructions
Rack pull muscle diagram

    Set up in a power rack with the bar on the pins. The pins should be set to the desired point; just below the knees, just above, or in the mid thigh position. Position yourself against the bar in proper deadlifting position. Your feet should be under your hips, your grip shoulder width, back arched, and hips back to engage the hamstrings. Since the weight is typically heavy, you may use a mixed grip, a hook grip, or use straps to aid in holding the weight.
    With your head looking forward, extend through the hips and knees, pulling the weight up and back until lockout. Be sure to pull your shoulders back as you complete the movement.
    Return the weight to the pins and repeat.

Dumbbell step-up

The dumbbell step-up is a great exercise for building lower-body strength and power. It targets all the same muscles as bodyweight step-ups, such as the quads, glutes, and hamstrings, but allows for greater muscular overload.
Benefits

    Builds lower-body strength and power
    Less of a balance challenge than barbell step-ups
    Reveals any strength imbalances between the legs

    Type: Strength

Dumbbell step-up Instructions
Dumbbell step-up muscle diagram

    Stand up straight while holding a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing the side of your legs).
    Place the right foot on the elevated platform. Step on the platform by extending the hip and the knee of your right leg. Use the heel mainly to lift the rest of your body up and place the foot of the left leg on the platform as well. Breathe out as you execute the force required to come up.
    Step down with the left leg by flexing the hip and knee of the right leg as you inhale. Return to the original standing position by placing the right foot of to next to the left foot on the initial position.
    Repeat with the right leg for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.

Note: This is a great exercise for people with lower back problems that are unable to do stiff legged deadlifts.

Variations: Just like lunges, this exercise can also be performed by alternating between the right and the left leg every time until all repetitions have been performed for both legs. Also, a barbell can be used for resistance. Beginners can start with only the bodyweight, especially if they have balance issues.

    Pause at the top of the motion, and return yourself to the start position.
    Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

    Bent-arm dumbbell pull-over

Bent-arm dumbbell pull-over

The bent-arm dumbbell pull-over was a staple exercise of the "Golden Era" of bodybuilding and a favorite of Arnold Schwarzenegger himself. Done properly, the exercise targets the pecs, lats, and serratus anterior muscles. Old-school bodybuilders would perform them with light weights for sets of 20 between sets of heavy 20-rep squats, but pull-overs are more popular today in moderate rep ranges, such as 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body workout.
Benefits

    Hits numerous upper-body muscles at once
    Helps make the serratus muscles pop
    Stretches the chest and lats
    Can help improve overhead shoulder mobility

    Type: Strength

Bent-arm dumbbell pull-over Instructions
Bent-arm dumbbell pull-over muscle diagram

    Place a dumbbell standing up on a flat bench.
    Ensuring that the dumbbell stays securely placed at the top of the bench, lie perpendicular to the bench (torso across it as in forming a cross) with only your shoulders lying on the surface. Hips should be below the bench and legs bent with feet firmly on the floor. The head will be off the bench as well.
    Grasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest with a bend in your arms. Both palms should be pressing against the underside one of the sides of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position. Caution: Always ensure that the dumbbell used for this exercise is secure. Using a dumbbell with loose plates can result in the dumbbell falling apart and falling on your face.
    While keeping your arms locked in the bent arm position, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest.
    At that point, bring the dumbbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement.
    Hold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions.

Caution: If you are new to this movement, have a spotter hand you the weight instead. If not, please ensure that the dumbbell does not fall on you as you arrange your torso to perform the exercise on the bench.

Also, as I already mentioned, ensure that the dumbbell used is in perfect working condition. Old dumbbells in need of welding should never be used to perform this exercise.

Variations:

    You can perform this exercise using a barbell or an e-z bar instead of dumbbells.
    Also, if using dumbbells like Powerblocks™, just use a dumbbell on each hand with the palms of your hands facing each other.

    Reverse-grip barbell curl

Reverse-grip barbell curl

The reverse-grip barbell curl is a variation on the biceps curl where the palms face downward. The switch from an underhand to an overhand grip brings the forearm and brachialis muscles more into the exercise. If it is uncomfortable to the wrists, try performing it on the angles of an EZ-curl bar.
Benefits

    Builds forearms more than underhand curl variations
    Builds biceps thickness and brachialis size
    Great high-rep finishing move for arms day

Reverse-grip barbell curl Instructions
Reverse-grip barbell curl muscle diagram

    Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at shoulder width with the elbows close to the torso. The palm of your hands should be facing down (pronated grip). This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the muscle.
    Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also perform this movement using an E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement. You can also use an E-Z bar as well.

Standing Cable Wood Chop Instructions
Standing Cable Wood Chop muscle diagram

    Connect a standard handle to a tower, and move the cable to the highest pulley position.
    With your side to the cable, grab the handle with one hand and step away from the tower. You should be approximately arm’s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable. Your outstretched arm should be aligned with the cable.
    With your feet positioned shoulder width apart, reach upward with your other hand and grab the handle with both hands. Your arms should still be fully extended.
    In one motion, pull the handle down and across your body to your front knee while rotating your torso.
    Keep your back and arms straight and core tight while you pivot your back foot and bend your knees to get a full range of motion.
    Maintain your stance and straight arms. Return to the neutral position in a slow and controlled manner.
    Repeat to failure.
    Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.

Tip: You will twist your entire body with this exercise, but really focus on getting maximal torso rotation and a strong clinch at the end of the movement. To ensure a good mind-muscle connection, keep your abs tense at all times.

    Cable rope hammer curl

Cable rope hammer curl

The cable rope hammer curl is a popular arm-focused exercise performed with a rope handle attached by a cable to a weight stack. It uses a neutral (palms facing one another) grip, which targets the forearms and brachialis muscles in addition to the biceps. Because grip is a limitation, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Works the biceps, forearms, brachialis, and brachioradialis
    Neutral grip may take pressure off of the wrists and elbows
    Cable allows for continuous tension throughout each rep

    Attach a rope attachment to a low pulley and stand facing the machine about 12 inches away from it.
    Grasp the rope with a neutral (palms-in) grip and stand straight up keeping the natural arch of the back and your torso stationary.
    Put your elbows in by your side and keep them there stationary during the entire movement. Tip: Only the forearms should move; not your upper arms. This will be your starting position.
    Using your biceps, pull your arms up as you exhale until your biceps touch your forearms. Tip: Remember to keep the elbows in and your upper arms stationary.
    After a 1 second contraction where you squeeze your biceps, slowly start to bring the weight back to the original position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with dumbbells.

    Reverse Machine Flyes

Reverse Machine Flyes

The machine rear delt fly is an exercise targeting the rear head of the shoulder muscle or deltoids, as well as the muscles of the upper back. It's sort of the reverse of the machine chest fly, and is sometimes performed on the same machine, but facing the opposite direction. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the posterior deltoids
    Easy to learn and master the technique
    Helps develop bigger, more balanced, and healthier shoulders
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day
    Works the rhomboids and lower and middle traps

    Adjust the handles so that they are fully to the rear. Make an appropriate weight selection and adjust the seat height so the handles are at shoulder level. Grasp the handles with your hands facing inwards. This will be your starting position.
    In a semicircular motion, pull your hands out to your side and back, contracting your rear delts.
    Keep your arms slightly bent throughout the movement, with all of the motion occurring at the shoulder joint.
    Pause at the rear of the movement, and slowly return the weight to the starting position.

    Single-leg kettlebell deadlift

Single-leg kettlebell deadlift

The kettlebell single-leg deadlift is a variation on the kettlebell deadlift where one foot stays planted on the ground while the other raises into the air at the bottom of the movement. It's popular in lower-body training for strength and muscle building, but also trains balance, grip, and the core muscles.
Benefits

    Targets each glute individually to strengthen both sides equally
    Builds back and glute strength and size, as well as grip strength
    Teaches and enforces the hip hinge movement pattern for deadlifts
    If balance is a challenge, the movement is still effective if you hold on to a post or other stable object

    Hold a kettlebell in one hand, hanging to the side. Stand on one leg, on the same side that you hold the kettlebell.
    Keeping that knee slightly bent, perform a stiff-legged deadlift by bending at the hip, extending your free leg behind you for balance. Continue lowering the kettlebell until you are parallel to the ground, and then return to the upright position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

Machine chest press

The machine chest press is a machine-based exercise targeting the chest. It approximates the motion of a bench press but is usually performed facing forward and seated upright. Many machines offer multiple grip options, such as overhand, neutral (palms facing), or underhand. The chest press is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a pre-exhaust or muscle-building upper-body workout.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the chest, anterior delts, and triceps
    Easy to change weight for dropsets
    Safe way to push intensity and weight

Machine chest press Instructions
Machine chest press muscle diagram

    Sit down on the Chest Press Machine and select the weight.
    Step on the lever provided by the machine since it will help you to bring the handles forward so that you can grab the handles and fully extend the arms.
    Grab the handles with a palms-down grip and lift your elbows so that your upper arms are parallel to the floor to the sides of your torso. Tip: Your forearms will be pointing forward since you are grabbing the handles. Once you bring the handles forward and extend the arms you will be at the starting position.
    Now bring the handles back towards you as you breathe in.
    Push the handles away from you as you flex your pecs and you breathe out. Hold the contraction for a second before going back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of reps.
    When finished step on the lever again and slowly get the handles back to their original place.

Variations: You can use free weights (barbells and dumbbells) to perform this exercise on a regular bench. Alternatively, you can use the pulley machine as well.

    Quadriceps
    Push-jerk

Push-jerk

The push-jerk is a movement in which the barbell is pushed from the front rack position to overhead with help from the legs. It differs from the push-press in that the lifter dips under the bar rather than simply pushing it up. It is popular in CrossFit workouts and Olympic weightlifting, as well as power training for athletics. It is usually performed for low reps, focusing on power and movement quality.
Benefits

    Builds full-body power, strength, and coordination
    Allows you to put heavier weight overhead than with the push-press or strict press
    May be more comfortable for some lifters than the split jerk

    Type: Olympic Weightlifting

Push-jerk Instructions
Push-jerk muscle diagram

    Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.
    Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.
    At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be moved to a slightly wider stance, with the knees partially bent.
    Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead.
    Return to a standing position.

Mixed Grip Chin Instructions
Mixed Grip Chin muscle diagram

    Using a spacing that is just about 1 inch wider than shoulder width, grab a pull-up bar with the palms of one hand facing forward and the palms of the other hand facing towards you. This will be your starting position.
    Now start to pull yourself up as you exhale. Tip: With the arm that has the palms facing up concentrate on using the back muscles in order to perform the movement. The elbow of that arm should remain close to the torso. With the other arm that has the palms facing forward, the elbows will be away but in line with the torso. You will concentrate on using the lats to pull your body up.
    After a second contraction at the top, start to slowly come down as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    On the following set, switch grips; so if you had the right hand with the palms facing you and the left one with the palms facing forward, on the next set you will have the palms facing forward for the right hand and facing you for the left.

Variations:

    If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.
    Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.
    On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.

Bradford/Rocky Presses muscle diagram

    Sit on a Military Press Bench with a bar at shoulder level with a pronated grip (palms facing forward). Tip: Your grip should be wider than shoulder width and it should create a 90-degree angle between the forearm and the upper arm as the barbell goes down. This is your starting position.
    Once you pick up the barbell with the correct grip, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms.
    Now lower the bar down to the back of the head slowly as you inhale.
    Lift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.
    Lower the bar down to the starting position slowly as you inhale. This is one repetition.
    Alternate in this manner until you complete the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: For more stress on the shoulders, only lift the bar until it is slightly above the head and then lower to the opposite side. In this manner you keep more constant tension on the shoulders while minimizing triceps involvement.

    Incline anti-gravity shoulder press

Incline anti-gravity shoulder press

The incline anti-gravity shoulder press is an upper-body exercise targeting the shoulders and upper back. It works the rear delts and upper-back muscles isometrically to hold the weight up, while dynamically training the lateral and front delts. Because of the challenge of holding the weight up, this press variation is usually performed with relatively light weights for moderate reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or shoulder training.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the shoulders and upper back
    Intense shoulder training even with light weight
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day

    Place a bar on the ground behind the head of an incline bench.
    Lay on the bench face down. With a pronated grip, pick the barbell up from the floor. Flex the elbows, performing a reverse curl to bring the bar near your chest. This will be your starting position.
    To begin, press the barbell out in front of your head by extending your elbows. Keep your arms parallel to the ground throughout the movement.
    Return to the starting position and repeat to complete the set.

    Barbell back squat

Barbell back squat

The barbell back squat is a popular compound movement that emphasizes building the lower-body muscle groups and overall strength. It's the classic way to start a leg day, and is a worthy centerpiece to a lower-body training program. The squat is a competitive lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also a classic measurement of lower-body strength. With the barbell racked on the traps or upper back, the emphasis is placed on the posterior chain but the entire body gets worked. The back squat can be trained in everything from heavy singles to sets of 20 reps or higher.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    Requires back and core strength to maintain torso positioning
    Can be used to improve conditioning and cardiovascular health
    Considered by many to be "the king of exercises"

Barbell back squat Instructions

    Begin by loading the bar appropriately and stepping under it, placing it across the back of the shoulders slightly below the rear deltoids in a “low-bar” position. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders.
    Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet in a wider-than-shoulder-width stance with the toes slightly pointed out and knees slightly bent. Keep your neck neutral. This will be your starting position.
    Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.

    Drive up through your heels, pushing your feet and knees out. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe, until you have returned to the starting position.
    Repeat for recommended amount of repetitions.

    Neutral-grip pull-up

Neutral-grip pull-up

The neutral-grip pull-up is a multijoint bodyweight exercise in which the reps are performed with the palms facing one another. Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core. It can be used as a more shoulder-friendly alternative to straight-bar pull-ups, or to help perform more reps than you can perform overhand.
Benefits

    Strengthens the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), biceps, upper back, core, and grip
    Requires no equipment other than a neutral-grip bar or monkey bars
    Can build absolute strength for low reps, or strength endurance for higher reps
    Many people find them slightly easier than straight-bar pull-ups
    Many people find they feel better on the shoulders than straight-bar pull-ups

    Pause at the top of the motion before lowering yourself to the starting position.

    Bodyweight triceps press

Bodyweight triceps press

The bodyweight triceps press is an arm movement that involves performing overhead presses in a face-down position on a Smith machine or other raised bar. It is a surprisingly difficult movement that hammers all three heads of the triceps and the difficulty can easily be scaled up or down by moving the bar.
Benefits

    Effective low-rep strength work for triceps
    Stretches and targets all three heads of the triceps, including the long head
    Surprising core work
    Can adjust the bar height up to make it easier, or down to make it more difficult

    Position a bar in a rack at chest height.
    Standing, take a shoulder width grip on the bar and step a yard or two back, feet together and arms extended so that you are leaning on the bar. This will be your starting position.
    Begin by flexing the elbow, lowering yourself towards the bar.
    Pause, and then reverse the motion by extending the elbows.
    Progress from bodyweight by adding chains over your shoulders.

    Connect an ankle strap attachment to a low pulley cable and position a mat on the floor in front of it.
    Sit down with your feet toward the pulley and attach the cable to your ankles.
    Lie down, elevate your legs and bend your knees at a 90-degree angle. Your legs and the cable should be aligned. If not, adjust the pulley up or down until they are.
    With your hands behind your head, bring your knees inward to your torso and elevate your hips off the floor.
    Pause for a moment and in a slow and controlled manner drop your hips and bring your legs back to the starting 90-degree angle. You should still have tension on your abs in the resting position.
    Repeat the same movement to failure.

Tip: Don’t put pressure against your neck when your hands are behind your head. This position is only to keep your upper back slightly elevated so your upper abs engage. If you tweak your neck, then reposition your arms at your side.

    Stand in front of a low pulley facing forward with one leg next to the pulley and the other one away.
    Attach the ankle cuff to the cable and also to the ankle of the leg that is next to the pulley.
    Now step out and away from the stack with a wide stance and grasp the bar of the pulley system.
    Stand on the foot that does not have the ankle cuff (the far foot) and allow the leg with the cuff to be pulled towards the low pulley. This will be your starting position.
    Now perform the movement by moving the leg with the ankle cuff in front of the far leg by using the inner thighs to abduct the hip. Breathe out during this portion of the movement.
    Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then repeat the same movement with the opposite leg.

Variations: You can use an inner thigh machine to perform this movement or you can also use ankle weights or an exercise band.

    Lying cable biceps curl

Lying cable biceps curl

The lying cable biceps curl is a cable exercise that targets the biceps. It is performed lying on the back, either on a bench or the ground, with the feet facing toward a cable stack. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps for a burn and pump as part of an arm-focused workout.
Benefits

    Builds strength and size in the biceps
    Lying down eliminates the possibility of using momentum from the lower body to raise the weight
    The cables provide constant tension on the muscles
    Serious biceps isolation if performed with strict form

    Type: Strength

    Grab a straight bar or E-Z bar attachment that is attached to the low pulley with both hands, using an underhand (palms facing up) shoulder-width grip.
    Lie flat on your back on top of an exercise mat in front of the weight stack with your feet flat against the frame of the pulley machine and your legs straight.
    With your arms extended and your elbows close to your body slightly bend your arms. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping your upper arms stationary and the elbows close to your body, curl the bar up slowly toward your chest as you breathe out and you squeeze the biceps.
    After a second squeeze at the top of the movement, slowly return to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also perform this exercise with exercise bands.

    Select the desired weight and lay down face up on the bench of a seated row machine that has a rope attached to it. Your head should be pointing towards the attachment.
    Grab the outside of the rope ends with your palms facing each other (neutral grip).
    Position your elbows so that they are bent at a 90 degree angle and your upper arms are perpendicular (90 degree angle) to your torso. Tip: Keep the elbows in and make sure that the upper arms point to the ceiling while your forearms point towards the pulley above your head. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe out, extend your lower arms until they are straight and vertical. The upper arms and elbows remain stationary throughout the movement. Only the forearms should move. Contract the triceps hard for a second.
    As you breathe in slowly return to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform the same movement using a flat bench and exercise bands or a low pulley that is set at the same level as your head is.

    Iliotibial band SMR

Iliotibial band SMR

Iliotibial band self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment for the lower body, usually using a foam roller or other "trigger point" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the IT band along the side of the upper leg, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight area to relax or "release." IT band SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the glute or quad muscles, or by stretches that target the glutes or quads.
Benefits

    Can encourage blood flow to the quadriceps muscles
    May be able to temporarily increase range of motion in the knee joints
    Effective as part of a warm-up or post-workout recovery
    Along with stretching the calves and quadriceps, some people find it can provide temporary relief from certain types of exercise-derived knee pain

    Lay on your side, with the bottom leg placed onto a foam roller between the hip and the knee. The other leg can be crossed in front of you.
    Place as much of your weight as is tolerable onto your bottom leg; there is no need to keep your bottom leg in contact with the ground. Be sure to relax the muscles of the leg you are stretching.
    Roll your leg over the foam from you hip to your knee, pausing for 10-30 seconds at points of tension. Repeat with the opposite leg.

    Head-on-bench dumbbell rear delt raise

Head-on-bench dumbbell rear delt raise

The head-on-bench dumbbell rear delt raise is an exercise targeting the posterior shoulder muscles, or rear deltoids. This variation of the bent-over rear delt raise often helps to better isolate this area of the shoulder. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the rear deltoids
    Positioning the head on the incline bench lowers the chance of using momentum to lift the weights
    Also works the traps and upper back

    Type: Strength

Head-on-bench dumbbell rear delt raise Instructions
Head-on-bench dumbbell rear delt raise muscle diagram

    Stand up straight while holding a dumbbell in each hand and with an incline bench in front of you.
    While keeping your back straight and maintaining the natural arch of your back, lean forward until your forehead touches the bench in front of you. Let the arms hang in front of you perpendicular to the ground. The palms of your hands should be facing each other and your torso should be parallel to the floor. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your torso forward and stationary, and the arms straight with a slight bend at the elbows, lift the dumbbells straight to the side until both arms are parallel to the floor. Exhale as you lift the weights. Caution: avoid swinging the torso or bringing the arms back as opposed to the side.
    After a one second contraction at the top, slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
    Repeat the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed with cables or seating.

    Pendlay Row

Pendlay Row

The Pendlay row, named after the well-known strength coach Glenn Pendlay, is a bent-over row variation where each rep starts with the barbell resting on the ground. This eliminates the stretch reflex and forces the lifter to pull with power and a bent-over spine. The Pendlay row can be performed heavy for low reps, but is usually performed for moderate reps, such as 5-8 per set.
Benefits

    Builds back strength and size
    Strengthens the core to keep lower back neutral
    Can typically use more weight than a normal bent-over row
    Excellent accessory movement for the deadlift

    Type: Strength

Pendlay Row Instructions
Pendlay Row muscle diagram

    Begin each repetition with the barbell dead on the ground. Take a medium pronated grip on the bar just in front of you. Your torso should be parallel to the ground with your lower back arched and knees partially bent.
    Begin with your shoulders protracted and your thoracic spine partially flexed. Your cervical spine should be neutral. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the pull by extending your thoracic spine as you flex the elbow, attempting to pull the weight into your abdomen as quickly as possible. Focus on squeezing your shoulders back as you perform the movement retracting your shoulder blades. There should be no movement at the hips or knees and strict technique should be utilized.
    Return the weight to the ground between repetitions.

Dumbbell Clean Instructions
Dumbbell Clean muscle diagram

    Begin standing with a dumbbell in each hand with your feet shoulder width apart.
    Lower the weights to the floor by flexing at the hips and knees, pushing your hips back until the dumbbells reach the floor. This will be your starting position.
    To initiate the movement, violently jump upward by extending the hips, knees, and ankles to acclerate the weights upward. Maintaining a neutral grip on the dumbbells, keep the arms straight until full extension is reached.
    After full extension, rebend the hips and knees to receive the weight in a squat position. Allow the arms to bend, guiding the dumbbells to your shoulders.
    Upon receiving the weight in the squat position, extend the hips and knees to finish in a standing position with the weights on your shoulders.

Lying rear delt fly

The lying rear delt fly is an upper-body exercise that targets the rear deltoid of the shoulder. By performing the movement lying face down on a bench, it eliminates momentum from the rest of the body. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Promotes shoulder health and balanced development
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day
    Strengthens important postural muscles in the upper back

    While holding a dumbbell in each hand, lay with your chest down on a flat bench.
    Position the palms of the hands in a neutral manner (palms facing your torso) as you keep the arms extended with the elbows slightly bent. This will be your starting position.
    Now raise the arms to the side until your elbows are at shoulder height and your arms are roughly parallel to the floor as you exhale. Tip: Maintain your arms perpendicular to the torso while keeping them extended throughout the movement. Also, keep the contraction at the top for a second.
    Slowly lower the dumbbells to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then switch to the other arm.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with just one arm and also keeping the palms of the hands facing back as opposed to facing your torso.

Seated Bent-Over Two-Arm Dumbbell Triceps Extension muscle diagram

    Sit down at the end of a flat bench with a dumbbell in both arms using a neutral grip (palms of the hand facing you).
    Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Make sure that you keep the head up.
    The upper arms with the dumbbells should be close to the torso and aligned with it (lifted up until they are parallel to the floor while the forearms are pointing towards the floor as the hands hold the weights). Tip: There should be a 90-degree angle between the forearms and the upper arm. This is your starting position.
    Keeping the upper arms stationary, use the triceps to lift the weight as you exhale until the forearms are parallel to the floor and the whole arm is extended. Like many other arm exercises, only the forearm moves.
    After a second contraction at the top, slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Variation:

    This exercise can be executed also one arm at a time or alternating (like alternating dumbbell curls)

Recumbent Bike muscle diagram

    To begin, seat yourself on the bike and adjust the seat to your height.
    Select the desired option from the menu. You may have to start pedaling to turn it on. You can use the manual setting, or you can select a program to use. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. The level of resistance can be changed throughout the workout. The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity.
    Recumbent bikes offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and have less impact than other activities. A 150 lb person will burn about 230 calories cycling at a moderate rate for 30 minutes, compared to 450 calories or more running.

    Standing barbell calf raise

Standing barbell calf raise

The standing barbell calf raise is a popular exercise to target the calf muscles of the lower leg, particularly the gastrocnemius muscle. It can be performed for time or for reps, either using a barbell or Smith machine bar if balance is a problem.
Benefits

    Stretches and targets the calf muscles to add size and strength
    Alter tempo or add pauses to increase intensity
    Can be performed with both legs at once, one leg at a time, or alternating
    Using weight allows tracking and periodization of training

Standing barbell calf raise Instructions
Standing barbell calf raise muscle diagram

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the bar on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck).
    Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Tip: For better range of motion you may also place the ball of your feet on a wooden block but be careful as this option requires more balance and a sturdy block.
    Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
    Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury.

Variations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise. A calf press machine instead of a squat rack can be used as well as dumbbells with one leg or two legs at a time. A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well. You can also perform the barbell calf raise using a piece of wood to place the ball of the foot. This will allow you to get a better range of motion. However be cautious as in this case you will need to balance yourself much better.

Treadmill walking

Treadmill walking is a popular cardiovascular exercise performed on a machine that is available in most gyms. Performing this exercise on a treadmill allows you to adjust the speed of your walking and, depending on the machine, perform it on an adjustable incline. Many machines also have built-in heart rate monitors and timers to help you track your progress.
Benefits

    Low-impact training for fat-loss and general health
    Excellent way to maintain or improve cardiovascular health
    Can track heart rate and time performed
    Not dependent on weather like walking outside

    Type: Cardio

Treadmill walking Instructions
Treadmill walking muscle diagram

    To begin, step onto the treadmill and select the desired option from the menu. Most treadmills have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.
    Treadmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than walking outside. When walking, you should move at a moderate to fast pace, not a leisurely one. Being an activity of lower intensity, walking doesn’t burn as many calories as some other activities, but still provides great benefit. A 150 lb person will burn about 175 calories walking 4 miles per hour for 30 minutes, compared to 450 calories running twice as fast. Maintain proper posture as you walk, and only hold onto the handles when necessary, such as when dismounting or checking your heart rate.

    Romanian Deadlift

Romanian Deadlift

The barbell stiff-legged deadlift targets the hamstrings, glutes, lower and upper back, as well as the core. It is a popular accessory movement for the deadlift, but also a muscle-building hamstring movement.
Benefits

    Stretches and engages the hamstrings and lower back to a greater degree than a bent knee position
    Also works the calves, quads, and forearms indirectly
    The barbell variation allows for heavier loading than with dumbbells
    Can use straps if grip is a limitation

Romanian Deadlift Instructions
Romanian Deadlift muscle diagram

    Hold a bar at hip level with a pronated (palms facing down) grip. Your shoulders should be back, your back arched, and your knees slightly bent. This will be your starting position.
    Lower the bar by moving your butt back as far as you can. Keep the bar close to your body, your head looking forward, and your shoulders back. Done correctly, you should reach the maximum range of your hamstring flexibility just below the knee. Any further movement will be compensation and should be avoided for this movement.
    At the bottom of your range of motion, return the starting position by driving the hips forward to stand up tall.

    Lay flat on the floor with your arms next to your sides.
    Now bend your knees at around a 75 degree angle and lift your feet off the floor by around 2 inches.
    Using your lower abs, bring your knees in towards you as you maintain the 75 degree angle bend in your legs. Continue this movement until you raise your hips off of the floor by rolling your pelvis backward. Breathe out as you perform this portion of the movement.

    Cable overhead triceps extension

Cable overhead triceps extension

The cable overhead triceps extension is a cable exercise performed in a seated position, targeting the triceps muscles. While it hits all three heads of the triceps, the overhead position helps to target the long head in particular. The seated position helps eliminate the use of momentum. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of the arm-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Builds strength and size in the triceps
    Great move to focus on the mind-muscle connection with light to moderate weight
    The cables provide constant tension on the muscles
    Targets the long head of the triceps

    Type: Strength

    Attach a rope to the bottom pulley of the pulley machine.
    Grasping the rope with both hands, extend your arms with your hands directly above your head using a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Your elbows should be in close to your head and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor with the knuckles aimed at the ceiling. This will be your starting position.
    Slowly lower the rope behind your head as you hold the upper arms stationary. Inhale as you perform this movement and pause when your triceps are fully stretched.
    Return to the starting position by flexing your triceps as you breathe out.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also do this seated with a bench that has back support, or you can use a dumbbell instead of the rope.

    Smith machine bent-over row

Smith machine bent-over row

The Smith machine bent-over row is an upper-body exercise targeting the muscles of the back, particularly the lats (latissimus dorsi). This movement can be programmed in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle and strength endurance. It is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or back-focused workout.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the lats and upper back
    Can easily set the safeties to a specific height
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to get into position and control

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Middle Back

Smith machine bent-over row muscle diagram

    Set the barbell attached to the smith machine to a height that is about 2 inches below your knees.
    Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up.
    Now grasp the barbell using an overhand (pronated) grip and unlock it from the smith machine rack. Then let it hang directly in front of you as your arms hang extended perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.
    While keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.
    Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution:

    This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.
    Also, just like with the bent knee deadlift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.
    Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

Variations: You can perform the same exercise using a supinated (palms facing you) grip. You can also use barbells and dumbbells.

Similar to the Barbell Bent Over Row but with a Smith Machine bar instead.

    Cable straight-bar upright row

Cable straight-bar upright row

The cable straight-bar upright row is an isolation exercise for the traps and the medial deltoids. It may not be appropriate for all lifters depending on their shoulder health and injury history. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.
Benefits

    Hits multiple upper-body muscles in a single movement
    The cable provides constant tension on the targeted muscles
    Can be done with varying grip width depending on shoulder comfort

Cable straight-bar upright row Instructions
Cable straight-bar upright row muscle diagram

    Grasp a straight bar cable attachment that is attached to a low pulley with a pronated (palms facing your thighs) grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The bar should be resting on top of your thighs. Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your back should be straight. This will be your starting position.
    Use your side shoulders to lift the cable bar as you exhale. The bar should be close to the body as you move it up. Continue to lift it until it nearly touches your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the bar, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.
    Lower the bar back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight or e-z bar. Another variation is to use dumbbells, though this later exercise should be reserved by the most advanced people that are well familiarized with correct execution.

    Set up a box in a power rack. The pins should be set at an appropriate height. Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders, not on top of your traps. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders.
    Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back. Keep your head facing forward. With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping the bar tight, bend forward at the hips as much as possible. If you set the pins to what would be parallel, you not only have a safety if you fail, but know when to stop.
    Pause just above the pins and reverse the motion until your torso it upright.

    Close-grip dumbbell bench press

Close-grip dumbbell bench press

The close-grip dumbbell bench press is a popular variation of the dumbbell bench press in which the dumbbells are held closer than shoulder width. This places more emphasis on the triceps, and perhaps also the inner chest. The close-grip dumbbell bench press can be performed in lower reps for strength or higher reps for muscle growth.
Benefits

    Increased triceps focus over normal grip
    Also works the chest and shoulders
    Many people find it more shoulder-friendly than the close-grip barbell bench press

    Ensuring that the dumbbell stays securely placed at the top of the bench, lie perpendicular to the bench with only your shoulders lying on the surface. Hips should be below the bench and your legs bent with your feet firmly on the floor.
    Grasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest at arm’s length. Both palms should be pressing against the underside of the sides of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by lowering the dumbbell to your chest.
    Return to the starting position by extending the elbows.

    Zercher squat

Zercher squat

The Zercher squat is a barbell exercise in which the bar is placed in the crease of your elbows as you perform a normal squat. This movement can be awkward at first but is extremely effective in building both size and strength.
Benefits

    Impossible to perform without fully engaging your entire body
    Builds the quads, glutes, hamstrings, biceps, and upper back
    Can be an alternative to spinal loading

    Type: Strength

Zercher squat Instructions
Zercher squat muscle diagram

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. The correct height should be anywhere above the waist but below the chest. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, lock your hands together and place the bar on top of your arms in between the forearm and upper arm.
    Lift the bar up so that it is resting on top of your forearms. If you are holding the bar properly, it should look as if you have your arms crossed but with a bar running across them.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).
    Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the ball of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This exercise is not to be taken lightly as you are applying a lot of pressure to your arms when lifting the barbell. It is always a good idea to have a spotter as they can help you keep proper form. Also, make sure that your back is kept straight as bending it can cause an injury.

    Either standing or seated on a high bench, grasp two stirrup cables that are attached to the high pulleys. Grab with the opposing hand so your arms are crisscrossed about you and your palms are facing forward.
    Keeping your chest up and maintaining a slight arch in your lower back, pull the handles down as if you were doing a regular pulldown. The range of motion will be more of an arc. During the movement, rotate your hands so that in the bottom position your palms face each other rather than forward. Return slowly to the starting position and repeat.

Cable Russian Twists Instructions
Cable Russian Twists muscle diagram

    Connect a standard handle attachment, and position the cable to a middle pulley position.
    Lie on a stability ball perpendicular to the cable and grab the handle with one hand. You should be approximately arm’s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable.
    Grab the handle with both hands and fully extend your arms above your chest. You hands should be directly in-line with the pulley. If not, adjust the pulley up or down until they are.
    Keep your hips elevated and abs engaged. Rotate your torso away from the pulley for a full-quarter rotation. Your body should be flat from head to knees.
    Pause for a moment and in a slow and controlled manner reset to the starting position. You should still have side tension on the cable in the resting position.
    Repeat the same movement to failure.
    Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.

Tip: It’s extremely important to keep your hips elevated during this exercise. If you do it correctly, your upper back will be on the ball, but your lower back and rear-end will be completely unsupported. Keeping your hips elevated will engage your core (lower back and abdominals), and make the exercise more effective.

Stiff Leg Barbell Good Morning Instructions
Stiff Leg Barbell Good Morning muscle diagram

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.
    Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your legs stationary, move your torso forward by bending at the hips while inhaling. Lower your torso until it is parallel with the floor.
    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by elevating your torso back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The stiff-legged barbell good morning is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.

Standing Dumbbell Reverse Curl Instructions
Standing Dumbbell Reverse Curl muscle diagram

    To begin, stand straight with a dumbbell in each hand using a pronated grip (palms facing down). Your arms should be fully extended while your feet are shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position.
    While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the muscle.
    Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also perform this movement using a straight bar or an E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement.

Lying Close-Grip Barbell Triceps Press To Chin muscle diagram

    While holding a barbell or EZ Curl bar with a pronated grip (palms facing forward), lie on your back on a flat bench with your head off the end of the bench. Tip: If you are holding a barbell grab it using a shoulder-width grip and if you are using an E-Z Bar grab it on the inner handles.
    Extend your arms in front of you as you hold the barbell over your chest. The arms should be perpendicular to your torso (90-degree angle). This will be your starting position.
    As you inhale, lower the bar in a semi-circular motion by bending at the elbows and while keeping the upper arm stationary and elbows in. Keep lowering the bar until it lightly touches your chin.
    As you exhale bring the bar back up to the starting position by pushing the bar up in a semi-circular motion. Contract the triceps hard at the top of the movement for a second. Tip: Again, only the forearms should move. The upper arms should remain stationary at all times.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: You can use dumbbells to make the exercise more challenging.

Tate Press Instructions
Tate Press muscle diagram

    Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
    By using your thighs to help you get the dumbbells up, clean the dumbbells one arm at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width. Note: when holding the dumbbells in front of you, make sure your arms are wider than shoulder width apart from each other using a pronated (palms forward) grip. Allow your elbows to point out. This is your starting position.
    Keeping the upper arms stationary, slowly move the dumbbells in and down in a semi circular motion until they touch the upper chest while inhaling. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times and do not move the upper arms nor rest the dumbbells on the chest.
    As you breathe out, move the dumbbells up using your triceps and the same semi-circular motion but in reverse. Attempt to keep the dumbbells together as they move up. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down again slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.

Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.

Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor.

    Ab Crunch Machine

Ab Crunch Machine

The machine crunch is a machine-based exercise targeting the abdominal muscles. It involves sitting upright in the machine and curling the torso down toward the chest against some pre-set level of resistance. On some machines, the knees also curl up torward the torso. Crunch machines usually use extra resistance in the form of selectorized weight stacks or plate loading, and are often performed for moderate to high reps, like 8-12 reps per set or higher, as part of the ab-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Works the rectus abdominus or "six-pack" muscles
    Allows for progressive overload in ab training
    Machine makes it difficult to cheat form
    Weighted ab training can help the core muscles grow and look more defined
    Easy weight changes for dropsets

    Select a light resistance and sit down on the ab machine placing your feet under the pads provided and grabbing the top handles. Your arms should be bent at a 90 degree angle as you rest the triceps on the pads provided. This will be your starting position.
    At the same time, begin to lift the legs up as you crunch your upper torso. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Be sure to use a slow and controlled motion. Concentrate on using your abs to move the weight while relaxing your legs and feet.
    After a second pause, slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Caution:

    For this exercise, always select a weight that you can easily handle as using too much weight can easily lead to injury.

Smith Machine Incline Bench Press

The Smith machine incline bench press is a machine-based movement targeting the chest, particularly the upper chest. The Smith machine mimics a barbell but provides more stability. This movement can be programmed in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle and strength endurance. It is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a chest or upper-body focused workout.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the chest and triceps
    Many lifters find they feel the movement more in their chest and less in their shoulders than the traditional bench press
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to control

    Type: Strength

Smith Machine Incline Bench Press Instructions
Smith Machine Incline Bench Press muscle diagram

    Place an incline bench underneath the smith machine. Place the barbell at a height that you can reach when lying down and your arms are almost fully extended. Once the weight you need is selected, lie down on the incline bench and make sure your upper chest is aligned with the barbell. Using a pronated grip (palms facing forward) that is wider than shoulder width, unlock the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your upper chest.
    After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.

Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter as this exercise can be a bit challenging. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.

Same as the Barbell Incline Bench Press but with a Smith Machine.

    Cuban press

Cuban press

The Cuban press is an exercise that targets the muscles of the shoulders, rotator cuff, and upper back. It combines a shoulder external rotation with a dumbbell press, training multiple muscles and motions in a single sequence. It can be performed standing, or as a more difficult variation face-down on an incline bench. It is usually performed with relatively light weight as part of a dynamic warm-up for upper-body lifting.
Benefits

    Activates and strengthens rotator cuff and shoulder stabilizer muscles
    Great warm-up for benching or heavier shoulder presses
    Can add size and definition to shoulders

Cuban press Instructions
Cuban press muscle diagram

    Take a dumbbell in each hand with a pronated grip in a standing position. Raise your upper arms so that they are parallel to the floor, allowing your lower arms to hang in the "scarecrow" position. This will be your starting position.
    To initiate the movement, externally rotate the shoulders to move the upper arm 180 degrees. Keep the upper arms in place, rotating the upper arms until the wrists are directly above the elbows, the forearms perpendicular to the floor.
    Now press the dumbbells by extending at the elbows, straightening your arms overhead.
    Return to the starting position as you breathe in by reversing the steps.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: You can also use a barbell.

    To begin, lie down on an incline bench set at a 30-degree angle with the chest and stomach pressing against the incline.
    Have the dumbbells in each hand with the palms facing down to the floor. Your arms should be in front of you so that they are perpendicular to the angle of the bench. Tip: Your elbows should have a slight bend. The legs should be stationary while applying pressure with the ball of your toes (your heels should not be touching the floor). This is the starting position.
    Maintaining the slight bend of the elbows, move the weights out and away from each other in an arc motion while exhaling.
    As you lift the weight, your wrist should externally rotate by 90-degrees so that you go from a palms down (pronated) grip to a palms facing each other (neutral) grip. Tip: Try to squeeze your shoulder blades together to get the best results from this exercise.
    The arms should be elevated until they are level with the head.
    Feel the contraction and slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Hanging wind sprint

Hanging wind sprint

The hanging wind sprint is a dynamic abdominal exercise that combines a sprinting motion with an alternating hanging knee-raise. It can be performed hanging from a bar, on a dip station or parallel bars, or if grip strength is a limitation, by placing the elbows in ab straps. If hanging from a straight bar is uncomfortable to the wrists or shoulders, you can also perform them hanging with a neutral grip (palms facing one another).
Benefits

    More difficult and time-efficient than high-rep ab exercises
    Can be performed for time or reps
    Can be performed on a number of different hanging implements

    Type: Strength

    Hang from a pull-up bar using a pronated grip. Your arms and legs should be extended. This will be your starting position.
    Begin by quickly raising one knee as high as you can. Do not swing your body or your legs.3
    Immediately reverse the motion, returning that leg to the starting position. Simultaneously raise the opposite knee as high as possible.
    Continue alternating between legs until the set is complete.

    Bent-arm barbell pull-over

Bent-arm barbell pull-over

The bent-arm barbell pull-over was a staple exercise of the "Golden Era" of bodybuilding and a favorite of Arnold Schwarzenegger himself. Done properly, the exercise targets the pecs, lats, and serratus anterior muscles. Old-school bodybuilders would perform them with light weights for sets of 20 between sets of heavy 20-rep squats, but pull-overs are more popular today in moderate rep ranges, such as 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body workout.
Benefits

    Hits numerous upper-body muscles at once
    Helps make the serratus muscles pop
    Works the chest and back from a unique angle
    Allows for a wider grip than dumbbell pull-overs

    Lie on a flat bench with a barbell using a shoulder grip width.
    Hold the bar straight over your chest with a bend in your arms. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping your arms in the bent arm position, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest.
    At that point, bring the barbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement.
    Hold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions.

Variations:

    You can perform this exercise using a dumbbell or an E-Z bar instead of dumbbells.

    Sphinx push-up

Sphinx push-up

The sphinx push-up is a difficult variation of the push-up that ends with the forearms on the ground in front of the body, rather than with the chest on the ground. It puts more stress on the triceps than traditional push-ups. It can be performed for time or reps in any bodyweight workout or during any arms-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Eliminates stretch reflex, forcing each rep to start from a dead stop
    Serious strength work for the triceps requiring no equipment
    Core gets worked in plank position

The Smith machine close-grip bench press is a machine-based movement targeting the chest and triceps. The Smith machine mimics a barbell but provides more stability. This movement can be programmed in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle and strength endurance. It is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a chest, arms, or upper-body focused workout.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the chest and triceps
    Allows for greater triceps work than wider grips

Smith Machine Close-Grip Bench Press muscle diagram

    Place a flat bench underneath the smith machine. Place the barbell at a height that you can reach when lying down and your arms are almost fully extended. Once the weight you need is selected, lie down on the flat bench. Using a close and pronated grip (palms facing forward) that is around shoulder width, unlock the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that as opposed to a regular bench press, you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement.
    After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, lock the bar back in the rack.

Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter as this exercise can be a bit challenging. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed with a barbell or e-z bar using the inner handle as well as dumbbells in which case the palms of the hands will be facing each other.

    Palms-out incline biceps curl

Palms-out incline biceps curl

The palms-out incline biceps curl is an exercise targeting the biceps. It is largely similar to the incline dumbbell curl, but the palms-out position targets the long head of the biceps, which is responsible for the biceps "peak." This curl variation is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or arm-focused training.
Benefits

    Adds size and definition to the biceps
    Positioning on the incline bench helps isolate the biceps and enforce strict form
    Great burnout movement on arm day

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Biceps
    Equipment: Dumbbell

Palms-out incline biceps curl Instructions
Palms-out incline biceps curl muscle diagram

    Hold a dumbbell in each hand and lie back on an incline bench.
    The dumbbells should be at arm's length hanging at your sides and your palms should be facing out. This will be your starting position.
    Now as you exhale curl the weight outward and up while keeping your forearms in line with your side deltoids. Continue the curl until the dumbbells are at shoulder height and to the sides of your deltoids. Tip: The end of the movement should look similar to a double biceps pose.
    After a second contraction at the top of the movement, start to inhale and slowly lower the weights back to the starting position using the same path used to bring them up.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also perform this exercise with cables or exercise bands.

Romanian Deadlift with Kettlebell Instructions
Romanian Deadlift with Kettlebell muscle diagram

    Begin in a standing position with a kettlebell held with both hands. Ensure that your back is straight and stays that way for the duration of the exercise. Allow your arms to hang perpendicular to the floor, with the wrists pronated and the elbows pointed to your sides. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by flexing your hips, slowly pushing your butt as far back as you can. This should entail a horizontal movement of the hips, rather than a downward movement. The knees should only partially bend, and your weight should remain on your heels. Drive your butt back as far as you can, which should generate tension in your hamstrings as your hands approach knee level. Maintain an arch in your back throughout the exercise.
    When your hips cannot perform any further backward movement, pause, and then slowly return to the starting position by extending the hips.

    Quadriceps
    Smith machine leg press

Smith machine leg press

The Smith machine leg press is a machine-based movement that targets the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. It can serve as a substitute for the leg press or be programmed similarly to the leg press. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of lower-body training. If your Smith machine has safety bars, set them at a height that allows you a full range of motion while giving adequate protection from the weight potentially falling.
Benefits

    Hammers the quads, glutes, and hammies
    Effective for high-rep leg training with light to moderate weights
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to control

    Type: Strength

    Position a Smith machine bar a couple feet off of the ground. Ensure that it is resting on the safeties. After loading the bar to an appropriate weight, lie underneath the bar. Place the middle of your feet on the bar, tucking your knees to your chest. This will be your starting position.
    Begin the movement by driving through your feet to move the bar upward, extending the hips and knees. Do not lock out your knees.
    At the top of the motion, pause briefly before returning to the starting position.

    Place a barbell on the floor.
    Stand in the middle of the bar length wise.
    Bend down by bending at the knees and keeping your back straight and grasp the front of the bar with your right hand. Your palm should be in (neutral grip) facing the left side.
    Grasp the rear of the bar with your left hand. The palm of your hand should be in neutral grip alignment (palms facing the right side). Tip: Ensure that your grip is even on the bar. Your torso should be positioned right in the middle of the bar and the distance between your torso and your right hand (which should be at the front) should be the same as the distance between your torso and your left hand (which should be to your back).
    Now stand straight up with the weight. Tip: Your feet should be shoulder width apart and your toes slightly pointed out.
    Squat down by bending at the knees and keeping your back straight until your upper thighs are parallel with the floor. Tip: Keep your back as vertical as possible with the floor and your head up. Also remember to not let your knees go past your toes. Inhale during this portion of the movement.
    Now drive yourself back up to the starting position by pushing with the feet . Tip: Keep the bar hanging at arm's length and your elbows locked with a slight bend. The arms only serve as hooks. Avoid doing any lifting with them. Do the lifting with your thighs; not your arms.

Variations: You can also perform the exercise using wrist wraps. In addition, you can use many of the other squat variations. Finally, you can also perform the exercise with a wide stance or a closer stance.

    Grab a single handle with your left arm next to the low pulley machine. Turn away from the machine keeping the handle to the side of your body with your arm fully extended. Now use both hands to elevate the single handle directly above the head with the palm facing forward. Keep your upper arm completely vertical (perpendicular to the floor) and put your right hand on your left elbow to help keep it steady. This is the starting position.
    Keeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.
    Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the single handle. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the exercise.

Variation: Another way to perform this exercise is to use the end of a rope attachment.

The Smith machine straight-legged hip raise is an exercise targeting the abdominal muscles. Because of the potential awkwardness of getting into position, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more. If your Smith machine has safety bars, set them at a height that allows you a full range of motion while giving adequate protection from the weight potentially falling.
Benefits

    Allows you to train in lower rep ranges when bodyweight ab training becomes too easy
    Weighted ab training can help the core muscles grow and look more defined
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to control

    Position a bench in the rack and load the bar to an appropriate weight. Lie down on the bench, placing the bottom of your feet against the bar. Unlock the bar and extend your legs. You may need to use your hands to assist you. For added stability grasp the sides of the Smith Machine. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by rotating your pelvis, flexing your spine to raise your hips off of the bench. Maintain a slight bend in the knees throughout the motion.
    After a brief pause, return the hips to the bench.
    Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

    Place your feet between the pads after loading an appropriate weight. Lay on the top pad, allowing your hips to hang off the back, while grasping the handles to hold your position.
    To begin the movement, flex the hips, pulling the legs forward.
    Reverse the motion by extending the hips, kicking the leg back. It is very important not to over-extend the hip on this movement, stopping short of your full range of motion.
    Return by again flexing the hip, pulling the carriage forward as far as you can.
    Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

    This movement strengthens the dip portion of the jerk. Begin with the bar racked in the jerk position, with the shoulders forward to create a shelf and the bar lightly contacting the throat. The feet should be directly under the hips, with the feet turned out as is comfortable.
    Keeping the torso vertical, dip by flexing the knees, allowing them to travel forward and without moving the hips to the rear. The dip should not be excessive. Return the weight to the starting position by driving forcefully though the feet.

It can be performed for reps or time, either for low reps to build explosive power or for higher reps for conditioning.
Benefits

    Builds explosive pushing strength
    Precursor to more advanced plyometric push-up variations
    Builds strength in the chest, triceps, shoulders, and core

    Type: Strength

    Place a kettlebell on the floor. Place yourself in a pushup position, on your toes with one hand on the ground and one hand holding the kettlebell, with your elbows extended. This will be your starting position.
    Begin by lowering yourself as low as you can, keeping your back straight.
    Quickly and forcefully reverse direction, pushing yourself up to the other side of the kettlebell, switching hands as you do so. Continue the movement by descending and repeating the movement back and forth.

    Weighted Sit-Ups - With Bands

Weighted Sit-Ups - With Bands

The weighted sit-up is a more difficult version of a highly popular abdominal movement. The simple addition of a weight makes the sit-up far more difficult, providing a different stimulus to the core during training and helping build strong abs.
Benefits

    Allows you to train in lower rep ranges when bodyweight sit-ups get easy
    Weighted ab training can help the core muscles grow and look more defined
    Increases abdominal strength, not just muscle tone

Weighted Sit-Ups - With Bands Instructions
Weighted Sit-Ups - With Bands muscle diagram

    Start out by strapping the bands around the base of the decline bench. Place the handles towards the inside of the decline bench so that when lying down, you can reach for both of them.
    Position your legs through the decline machine until they are secured. Now reach for the exercise bands with both hands. Use a pronated (palms forward) grip to grasp the handles. Position them near your collar bone and rotate your wrist to a neutral grip (palms facing the torso). Note: Your arms should remain stationary throughout the exercise. This is the starting position.
    Move your torso upward until your upper body is perpendicular to the floor while exhaling. Hold the contraction for a second and lower your upper body back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also use a stationary post and wrap the exercise band around it to perform this exercise. Simply lie down on the floor and use the same techniques as described above except this time you will not be on a decline bench. Note: If you are going to perform the exercise in this manner, it is best to have a partner hold your feet down.

    Quadriceps
    Depth jump box jump

Depth jump box jump

The depth jump box jump is a plyometric exercise that entails jumping off one box, dropping into a squat, and then jumping up onto another box. These are all performed fluidly to complete one rep. Depth jumps have been a staple of high-level athletic programming for decades. They are usually performed for low reps with a focus on power and technique. If they hurt your knees or back, consider performing box jumps or squat jumps instead.
Benefits

    Builds elite-level leg strength and power
    Improves all-around athleticism
    Increases vertical jumping ability

    Type: Plyometrics
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps

    For this drill you will need two boxes or benches, one 12 to 16 inches high and the other 22 to 26 inches high.
    Stand on one of the two boxes with arms at the sides; feet should be together and slightly off the edge as in the depth jump. Place the other box approximately two or three feet in front of and facing the performer.
    Begin by dropping off the initial box, landing and simultaneously taking off with both feet.
    Rebound by driving upward and outward as intensely as possible, using the arms and full extension of the body to jump onto the higher box. Again, allow the legs to absorb the impact.

Lying Machine Squat Instructions
Lying Machine Squat muscle diagram

    Adjust the leg machine to a height that will allow you to get inside it with your knees bent and the thighs slightly below parallel.
    Once you select the weight, position yourself inside the machine face up with the knees bent and thighs slightly below parallel to the platform. Make sure that the knees do not go past the toes. The angle created between the hamstrings and the calves should be one that is slightly less than 90 degrees (since your starting position requires you to start slightly below parallel). Your back and your head should be resting on the machine while your shoulders are pressed under the shoulder pads.
    Place your hands by the handles and position your feet slightly pointing out at a shoulder width position. This will be your starting position.
    While pressing with the balls of the feet as you breathe out, make your whole body erect as you squeeze the quads. Hold the contracted position for a second. Tip: Since you are starting below parallel, you can opt to use your hands to help you up by pressing on your thighs only on the first repetition.
    Slowly squat down as you inhale but instead of going all the way down to the starting position, just stop once your thighs are parallel to the platform. The angle between your hamstrings and calves should be a 90-degree angle.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Keep your lower back and head pressed against the machine at all times.

Variations: You can use a wide or close stance as well.

    Seated Leg Curl

Seated Leg Curl

The leg curl is a popular machine-based exercise for the legs, particularly the hamstrings. It comes in seated and lying varieties, but the seated leg curl machine is more common in commercial gyms. Leg curl variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a leg pre-exhaust or as a muscle-building movement for lower-body training.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the hamstrings
    Less glute and hamstring involvement than lying curl variations
    Great accessory movement for a stronger squat and deadlift
    Great burnout on leg day

    Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and sit on the machine with your back against the back support pad.
    Place the back of lower leg on top of padded lever (just a few inches under the calves) and secure the lap pad against your thighs, just above the knees. Then grasp the side handles on the machine as you point your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances) and ensure that the legs are fully straight right in front of you. This will be your starting position.
    As you exhale, pull the machine lever as far as possible to the back of your thighs by flexing at the knees. Keep your torso stationary at all times. Hold the contracted position for a second.
    Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Do not ever use so much weight on the exercise that you start using swinging and jerking as you can risk both lower back injury and also a hamstring tear.

Variations: Since you have three foot positions you have in reality three exercises.

    Standing Barbell Press Behind Neck

Standing Barbell Press Behind Neck

The standing behind-the-head press is a classic shoulder exercise that was used widely during bodybuilding's professed Golden Era. In addition to the deltoids, it also works the trapezius and triceps muscles. It may not be a good choice for some people's shoulders, depending on their injury history. It can be trained in strength-focused rep ranges, but is more commonly trained in moderate to high reps, such as 8-15 reps per set.
Benefits

    Builds shoulder size and strength
    Avoids overloading the front deltoids from doing only pressing in front
    The standing position also challenges the core and legs

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for easier pick up of the bar. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.
    Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Your back should be kept straight while performing this exercise. This will be your starting position.
    Elevate the barbell overhead by fully extending your arms while breathing out.
    Hold the contraction for a second and lower the barbell back down to the starting position by inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Performing this exercise can cause serious injury if not performed properly. Make sure to keep your back straight when lowering and lifting the barbell.

Benefits

    Isolates one side at a time to work on movement patterns and imbalances
    Great burnout movement on shoulder day

    While holding a dumbbell in one hand, lay with your chest down on a flat bench. The other hand can be used to hold to the leg of the bench for stability.
    Position the palm of the hand that is holding the dumbbell in a neutral manner (palms facing your torso) as you keep the arm extended with the elbow slightly bent. This will be your starting position.
    Now raise the arm with the dumbbell to the side until your elbow is at shoulder height and your arm is roughly parallel to the floor as you exhale. Tip: Maintain your arm perpendicular to the torso while keeping your arm extended throughout the movement. Also, keep the contraction at the top for a second.
    Slowly lower the dumbbell to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with both arms at the same time and also keeping the palms of the hands facing back as opposed to facing your torso.

Cable shrug Instructions
Cable shrug muscle diagram

    Grasp a cable bar attachment that is attached to a low pulley with a shoulder width or slightly wider overhand (palms facing down) grip.
    Stand erect close to the pulley with your arms extended in front of you holding the bar. This will be your starting position.
    Lift the bar by elevating the shoulders as high as possible as you exhale. Hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: The arms should remain extended at all times. Refrain from using the biceps to help lift the bar. Only the shoulders should be moving up and down.
    Lower the bar back to the original position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with bands, barbells or dumbbell. You can also use a single handle and work one side at a time.

    Pallof press with rotation

Pallof press with rotation

The Pallof press with rotation is a dynamic variation of the Pallof press that incorporates weighted rotation away from the torso using resistance from a cable pulley. It is intended to build abdominal strength and teach proper bracing. It can be performed for time or for reps in the core-focused portion of any workout.
Benefits

    Builds abdominal strength and muscle control
    Added engagement from the obliques during the rotation
    Can also be performed with bands if cables are unavailable

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Abdominals

Pallof press with rotation muscle diagram

    Connect a standard handle to a tower, and position the cable to shoulder height.
    With your side to the cable, grab the handle with one hand and step away from the tower. You should be approximately arm’s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable. Align outstretched arm with cable.
    With your feet positioned hip-width apart, pull the cable into your chest and grab the handle with your other hand. Both hands should be on the handle at this time.
    Facing forward, press the cable away from your chest. You core should be tight and engaged.
    Keeping your hips straight, twist your torso away from the pulley until you get a full quarter rotation.
    Maintain your rigid stance and straight arms. Return to the neutral position in a slow and controlled manner. Your arms should be extended in front of you.
    With the side tension still engaging your core, bring your hands to your chest and immediately press outward to a fully extended position. This constitutes one rep.
    Repeat to failure.
    Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.

Tip: The closer you keep your feet together, the greater the core activation. A wide base puts the pressure on your legs instead of your core.

Lying T-Bar Row muscle diagram

    Load up the T-bar Row Machine with the desired weight and adjust the leg height so that your upper chest is at the top of the pad. Tip: In some machines all you can do is stand on the appropriate step that allows you to be at a height that has the upper chest at the top of the pad.
    Lay face down on the pad and grab the handles. You can either use a palms down, palms up, or palms in position depending on what part of your back you want to emphasize.
    Lift the bar off the rack and extend your arms in front of you. This will be your starting position.
    As you exhale slowly pull the weight up and squeeze your back at the top of the movement. Tip: Keep the upper arms as close to the torso as possible throughout the movement in order to better engage the back muscles. Also, do not lift your body off of the pad at any time and refrain from using the biceps to lift the weight.
    After a second contraction at the top of the movement, as you inhale, slowly go back down to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Kneeling lat pull-down

Kneeling lat pull-down

The kneeling lat pull-down is a variation of the lat pull-down exercise performed with the knees on the ground rather than sitting on a bench or machine. It has all of the same benefits of a lat pull-down performed on a bench or machine, in addition to providing further activation to the core and lower body.
Benefits

    Strengthens the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), upper back, and biceps
    Activates and strengthens the glutes and core more than standard lat pull-downs
    Co-contracting the glutes and core can help further activate the lat muscles
    Can be performed at any cable station if a lat pull-down machine is unavailable

    After pausing briefly, slowly return to the starting position.

Standing Bent-Over One-Arm Dumbbell Triceps Extension muscle diagram

    With a dumbbell in one hand and the palm facing your torso, bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Make sure that you keep the head up.
    The upper arm should be close to the torso and parallel to the floor while the forearm is pointing towards the floor as the hand holds the weight. Tip: There should be a 90-degree angle between the forearm and the upper arm. This is your starting position.
    Keeping the upper arms stationary, use the triceps to lift the weights as you exhale until the forearms are parallel to the floor and the whole arm is extended. Like many other arm exercises, only the forearm moves.
    After a second contraction at the top, slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the exercise.

Overhead squat

The overhead squat is a full-body, functional movement that works to build full-body strength and stability. It is most often seen in training for Olympic weightlifting or CrossFit, but can also be performed with light weights for a shoulder stability focus. It is usually performed with the heels elevated to allow for greater squat depth.
Benefits

    Develops mobility and stability in the hips, shoulders, and thoracic spine
    Builds strength and size in the lower and upper body
    Great carryover to the barbell snatch

    Type: Olympic Weightlifting

Overhead squat Instructions
Overhead squat muscle diagram

    Start out by having a barbell in front of you on the floor. Your feet should be wider than shoulder width apart from each other.
    Bend the knees and use a pronated grip (palms facing you) to grab the barbell. Your hands should be at a wider than shoulder width apart from each other before lifting. Once you are positioned, lift the barbell up until you can rest it on your chest.
    Move the barbell over and slightly behind your head and make sure your arms are fully extended. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. Retract your shoulder blades. This is your starting position.
    Slowly lower the weight by bending your knees until your thighs are parallel to the ground while inhaling. Tip: Keep your back straight while performing this exercise to avoid any injuries and your arms should remain extended and over your head at all times.
    Now use your feet and legs to help bring the weight back up to the starting position while exhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Use a weight that you are comfortable with to develop proper form.

    To begin, stand on an exercise band so that tension begins at arm's length. Grasp the handles using a pronated (palms facing your thighs) grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The handles should be resting on the sides of your thighs. Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your back should be straight. This will be your starting position.
    Use your side shoulders to lift the handles to the sides as you exhale. Continue to lift the handles until they are slightly above parallel. Tip: As you lift the handles, slightly tilt the hand as if you were pouring water and keep your arms extended. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.
    Lower the handles back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed using dumbbells or a pulley machine.

    Single-arm dumbbell upright row

Single-arm dumbbell upright row

The single-arm dumbbell upright row is a popular movement for building stronger and bigger traps and shoulders. Many lifters combine this move with either their back or shoulder workout, since it involves both body parts. It is generally performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Builds stronger, bigger traps and lateral deltoids
    More shoulder-friendly than barbell upright rows
    Allows for focus on one side of the muscle at a time

    Type: Strength

Single-arm dumbbell upright row Instructions
Single-arm dumbbell upright row muscle diagram

    Grab a dumbbell and stand up straight with your arm extended in front of you with a slight bend at the elbows and your back straight. This will be your starting position. Tip: The dumbbell should be resting on top of your thigh with the palm of your hands facing your thighs.
    Keep the other hand can be kept fully extended to the side, by the waist or grabbing a fixed surface. This will be your starting position.
    Use your side shoulders to lift the dumbbell as you exhale. The dumbbell should be close to the body as you move it up. Continue to lift it until the dumbbell is nearly in line with your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbell, your elbow should always be higher than your forearm. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.
    Lower the dumbbell back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and switch arms.

Caution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using an e-z bar, cables and exercise band.

    Lie flat on your back, bend one knee, and put that foot flat on the floor to stabilize your spine.
    Extend the other leg in the air. If you're tight, you wont be able to straighten it. That's okay. Extend the knee so that the sole of the lifted foot faces the ceiling (or as close as you can get it).
    Slowly straighten the legs as much as possible and then pull the leg toward your nose. Switch sides.

    Start out by placing a flat bench in front of a low pulley cable that has a straight bar attachment.
    Use your arms to grab the cable bar with a narrow to shoulder width supinated grip (palms up) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the top of your thighs. Your wrists should be hanging just beyond your knees.
    Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling. Keep the contraction for a second.
    Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can also be performed sitting down by kneeling and using the bench as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over the bench and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed.
    You can also use a dumbbell instead of a barbell.

Upright Row - With Bands muscle diagram

    To begin, stand on an exercise band so that tension begins at arm's length. Grasp the handles using a pronated (palms facing your thighs) grip that is slightly less than shoulder width. The handles should be resting on top of your thighs. Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your back should be straight. This will be your starting position.
    Use your side shoulders to lift the handles as you exhale. The handles should be close to the body as you move them up. Continue to lift the handles until they nearly touches your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the handles, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.
    Lower the handles back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight or e-z bar. Another variation is to use dumbbells, though this later exercise should be reserved by the most advanced people that are well familiarized with correct execution.

    Exercise ball hip thrust

Exercise ball hip thrust

The exercise ball hip thrust is a simple yet effective way to work the glutes and hamstrings. Proper form is essential to really feel the burn in the glutes, and the ball can help guide you into the right form better than a bench, which is the usual support for hip thrusts. Unlike the bench version, the ball hip thrust is best performed with body weight or bands as resistance for safety reasons. It can be an excellent component of a warm-up for lower-body training, or a glute activation drill performed anytime.
Benefits

    Works the glutes and hamstrings
    Excellent warm-up before squats or deadlifts
    Works well unweighted or with bands
    Great way to hit the lower body outside of the gym

    Type: Strength

    Pause at the top of the motion and return to the starting position.

See-Saw Press (Alternating Side Press) muscle diagram

    Grab a dumbbell with each hand and stand up erect.
    Clean (lift) the dumbbells to the chest/shoulder level and then rotate your wrists so that your palms are facing towards you as if you were getting ready to perform an Arnold Press. This will be your starting position.
    Now start extending your left arm overhead as you rotate the wrist so that the palm of your hand faces forward as you go up. Your elbows should come out also as you lift the weight. Simultaneously, you will also be bending from your hip to your opposite side. Tip: If you perform the exercise correctly, is should look as if you are trying to reach for something overhead on the right hand side of your body, but with your left arm. Breathe out as you perform this movement.
    Once you reach the top position breathe in. Then, with the weight fully extended overhead and you bent over to your right hand side, begin the movement to the left side.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Be extremely careful with the weight used as using a weight that you cannot control can cause back injury.

Sumo Deadlift with Chains Instructions
Sumo Deadlift with Chains muscle diagram

    You can attach the chains to the sleeves of the bar, or just drape the middle over the bar so there is a greater weight increase as you lift. Attempt to keep the ends of the chains away from the plates so you don't hit them when you lower the weight.
    Begin with a bar loaded on the ground. Approach the bar so that the bar intersects the middle of the feet. The feet should be set very wide, near the collars. Bend at the hips to grip the bar. The arms should be directly below the shoulders, inside the legs, and you can use a pronated grip, a mixed grip, or hook grip. Relax the shoulders, which in effect lengthens your arms.
    Take a breath, and then lower your hips, looking forward with your head with your chest up. Drive through the floor, spreading your feet apart, with your weight on the back half of your feet. Extend through the hips and knees.
    As the bar passes through the knees, lean back and drive the hips into the bar, pulling your shoulder blades together.
    Return the weight to the ground by bending at the hips and controlling the weight on the way down.

    Lie with your back flat on the floor (or exercise mat) and your legs extended in front of you.
    Now bend at the knees and place your outer thighs by the floor (or mat) as you make the soles of your feet touch each other.
    Now try pushing both soles and bringing them up as near you as possible while you keep the outer thighs on the floor (or at least almost touching it). Tip: In this position your legs should create a diamond shape.
    Now, cross your arms in front of you by touching the opposite shoulders. This will be your starting position.
    As you exhale flatten your lower back to the floor while curling the torso upwards. Tip: This will be like performing the first 1/4 movement of a sit up. Hold at the top position for a second.
    As you inhale, slowly lower back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Kettlebell Windmill

Kettlebell Windmill

The single-kettlebell windmill is a dynamic kettlebell exercise emphasizing core strength and shoulder and hip mobility and stability. It is often used as a functional warm-up or for multi-directional strength work. It doesn't work as well in a metcon or conditioning setting, and shouldn't be performed under intense fatigue.
Benefits

    Builds strength throughout the abdomen, particularly the deep core (transversus abdominus) and obliques
    Easy to regress by limiting range of motion
    Can be performed with a light weight for beginners
    Builds shoulder stability, hip mobility, and thoracic spine mobility

    Place a kettlebell in front of your lead foot and clean and press it overhead with your opposite arm. Clean the kettlebell to your shoulder by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the kettlebell towards your shoulders. Rotate your wrist as you do so, so that the palm faces forward. Press it overhead by extending the elbow.
    Keeping the kettlebell locked out at all times, push your butt out in the direction of the locked out kettlebell. Turn your feet out at a forty-five degree angle from the arm with the locked out kettlebell. Bending at the hip to one side, sticking your butt out, slowly lean until you can touch the floor with your free hand. Keep your eyes on the kettlebell that you hold over your head at all times.
    Pause for a second after reaching the ground and reverse the motion back to the starting position.

    Board bench press

Board bench press

The board bench press is an upper-body exercise that is commonly performed as an assistance movement for the bench press. It targets the same muscles as the bench press, including the chest and shoulders, but really focuses on the triceps. Because you can load it more heavily than a full bench press, it allows you to overload the triceps and lock out of the bench press.
Benefits

    Targets lockout strength and triceps
    Allows heavier weights to be used
    May help lifters with shoulder issues experience less discomfort while pressing
    Time-tested powerlifting assistance movement

    Type: Powerlifting

Board bench press Instructions
Board bench press muscle diagram

    Begin by lying on the bench, getting your head beyond the bar if possible. One to five boards, made out of 2x6's, can be screwed together and held in place by a training partner, bands, or just tucked under your shirt.
    Tuck your feet underneath you and arch your back. Using the bar to help support your weight, lift your shoulder off the bench and retract them, squeezing the shoulder blades together. Use your feet to drive your traps into the bench. Maintain this tight body position throughout the movement.
    You can take a standard bench grip, or shoulder width to focus on the triceps. Pull the bar out of the rack without protracting your shoulders. The bar, wrist, and elbow should stay in line at all times. Focus on squeezing the bar and trying to pull it apart.
    Lower the bar to the boards, and then drive the bar up with as much force as possible. The elbows should be tucked in until lockout.

Frankenstein Squat Instructions
Frankenstein Squat muscle diagram

    This drill teaches you the proper positioning of both the bar and your body during the clean and front squat.
    Place the barbell on the front of the shoulders, releasing your grip and extending your arms out in front of you. The shoulders should be pushed forward to create a shelf, and the bar should be in contact with the throat. Ensure that you only move your shoulder blades forward; don't round the thoracic spine.
    Squat by flexing the knees and hips, sitting in between your legs. Keep the torso upright, the arms up, and the shoulders forward, and the bar should stay in place. Go to the bottom of the squat, until your hamstrings contact your calves.
    Return to the upright position by driving through the front of the heel and extending the knees and hips.

    Seat on a flat bench with your back facing a high pulley.
    Grasp the cable rope attachment with both hands (with the palms of the hands facing each other) and place your hands securely over both shoulders. Tip: Allow the weight to hyperextend the lower back slightly. This will be your starting position.
    With the hips stationary, flex the waist so the elbows travel toward the hips. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    As you inhale, go back to the initial position slowly.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: Exercise bands can be used for this exercise.

    Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell at waist height in front of you with both hands. You should be looking straight forward, with your chest up and shoulders back. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by shifting your weight to your right foot, lifting your left from the ground. While keeping your torso facing forward, place your left leg behind your right, taking a wide, lateral step behind the front leg.
    Descend into a lunge by bending your knees, lowering your body straight down. Continue until your front knee is at approximately 90 degrees, and then drive through the heel and extend the knee and hip.
    As you come back up, return the back leg to the starting position. Alternate the movement; switch back and forth between both sides for the desired number of repetitions.

    Quadriceps
    Barbell speed squat

Barbell speed squat

The barbell speed squat targets the lower-body muscle groups using lighter weights to perform fast-paced back squats. Speed squats are popular in certain powerlifting training methodologies as a way to engrain form and lifting speed that can carry over to max-effort lifts. In this approach, they are usually performed in numerous sets of 3-5 reps with adequate rest in between. Speed squats are also sometimes performed with bands or chains adding extra resistance to the top half of the lift.
Benefits

    Builds and strengthens the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    Quick muscle contractions target the fast-twitch (type II) muscle fibers
    Works core and upper-back strength to remain upright

Barbell speed squat Instructions
Barbell speed squat muscle diagram

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.
    Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).
    Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
    Begin to raise the bar as fast as possible without involving momentum as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Note: You should perform these exercises as fast as possible but without breaking perfect form and without involving momentum.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly due to the speed that it requires. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.

Circus Bell muscle diagram

    The circus bell is an oversized dumbbell with a thick handle. Begin with the dumbbell between your feet, and grip the handle with both hands.
    Clean the dumbbell by extending through your hips and knees to deliver the implement to the desired shoulder, letting go with the extra hand.
    Ensure that you get one of the dumbbell heads behind the shoulder to keep from being thrown off balance. To raise it overhead, dip by flexing the knees, and the drive upwards as you extend the dumbbell overhead, leaning slightly away from it as you do so.
    Carefully guide the bell back to the floor, keeping it under control as much as possible. It is best to perform this event on a thick rubber mat to prevent damage to the floor.

Suspended row

The suspended row is a bodyweight pulling exercise that focuses on the muscles of the middle and upper back, as well as the biceps. It can be trained in traditional muscle-building rep ranges or for higher reps. It can also work as part of a dynamic warm-up for a pressing or pulling-focused workout.
Benefits

    Strengthens the lats (latissimus dorsi), biceps, rear delts, and rhomboids
    Safer to do for high reps than many free-weight row variations
    Easy to alter the angle to make the movement more or less difficult
    Can add pauses or control tempo to make more difficult
    Allows natural rotation of the hands unlike when using a barbell

Incline Bench Pull Instructions
Incline Bench Pull muscle diagram

    Grab a dumbbell in each hand and lie face down on an incline bench that is set to an incline that is approximately 30 degrees.
    Let the arms hang to your sides fully extended as they point to the floor.
    Turn the wrists until your hands have a pronated (palms down) grip.
    Now flare the elbows out. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe out, start to pull the dumbbells up as if you are doing a reverse bench press. You will do this by bending at the elbows and bringing the upper arms up as you let the forearms hang. Continue this motion until the upper arms are at the same level as your back. Tip: The elbows will come out to the side and your upper arms and torso should make the letter "T" at the top of the movement. Hold the contraction at the top for a second.
    Slowly go back down to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this same movement but with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). You can also use a barbell.

    Lay down on a flat bench holding a dumbbell in each hand with the palms of the hands facing towards the ceiling. Tip: Your arms should be parallel to the floor and next to your thighs. To avoid injury, make sure that you keep your elbows slightly bent. This will be your starting position.
    Now move the dumbbells by creating a semi-circle as you displace them from the initial position to over the head. All of the movement should happen with the arms parallel to the floor at all times. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Reverse the movement to return the weight to the starting position as you exhale.

Benefits

    Builds serious triceps strength
    Excellent bodyweight substitute for JM press and other triceps strength exercises

Tiger-bend push-up muscle diagram

    Begin in the top position of a push-up: arms extended, back and neck in a straight line, and core tight with your hands slightly wider than shoulder width. This will be your starting position.
    Lower yourself to a bottom push-up position with your chest slightly above the floor. Rock backwards by bringing your elbows back and forearms to the ground, pushing through your palms. Your hips may rise slightly as you move back. This is OK.
    Transition back to the bottom push-up position by rocking forward. Then, push up to the starting position. This is one repetition.
    Repeat for the recommended number of repetitions.

    Face-down incline dumbbell biceps curl

Face-down incline dumbbell biceps curl

The face-down incline dumbbell biceps curl is an exercise targeting the biceps and performed face down on an incline bench. This creates a vertical arm angle, which helps to isolate the biceps and limit involvement of the shoulder muscles. This curl variation is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or arm-focused training.
Benefits

    Adds size and definition to the biceps
    Positioning on the incline bench helps isolate the biceps and enforce strict form
    Great burnout movement on arm day

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Biceps
    Equipment: Dumbbell

Face-down incline dumbbell biceps curl Instructions
Face-down incline dumbbell biceps curl muscle diagram

    Grab a dumbbell on each hand and lie face down on an incline bench with your shoulders near top of the incline. Your knees can rest on the seat or your legs can be straddled to the sides (my preferred way).
    Let your arms extend and hang naturally in front of you so that they are perpendicular to the floor.
    Now keep your elbows in by your side and face the palms forward. This will be your starting position.
    Raise the dumbbells by contracting the biceps until your arms are fully flexed. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and ensure that only the forearms move. The upper arms should remain stationary at all times.
    Lower the dumbbells until your arms are fully extended.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of times.

Variations: You can perform using an e-z bar, a barbell or alternating arms. You can also use a cable machine as well.

    Begin kneeling on the floor with a barbell racked across the back of your shoulders, or you can use your body weight for this exercise. This can be done inside of a power rack to make unracking easier.
    Sit back with your hips until your glutes touch your feet, keeping your head and chest up.
    Explode up with your hips, generating enough power to land with your feet flat on the floor.
    Continue with the squat by driving through your heels and extending the knees to come to a standing position.

    Place a neck strap on the floor at the end of a flat bench. Once you have selected the weights, sit at the end of the flat bench with your feet wider than shoulder width apart from each other. Your toes should be pointed out.
    Slowly move your torso forward until it is almost parallel with the floor. Using both hands, securely position the neck strap around your head. Tip: Make sure the weights are still lying on the floor to prevent any strain on the neck. Now grab the weight with both hands while elevating your torso back until it is almost perpendicular to the floor. Note: Your head and torso needs to be slightly tilted forward to perform this exercise.
    Now place both hands on top of your knees. This is the starting position.
    Slowly lower your neck down until your chin touches the upper part of your chest while breathing in.
    While exhaling, bring your neck back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This exercise puts a lot of stress on the neck muscles and should be approached with caution. Any sudden jerk or movement can cause you to strain a neck muscle. It is best to practice the form at first without any weights to get used to the movements required for this exercise.

    Band-assisted pull-up

Band-assisted pull-up

The band-assisted pull-up is a variation of the pull-up exercise in which the reps are performed with an elastic band looped around the feet or knees. This reduces weight and resistance at the bottom of the rep, while increasing it toward the top. Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core, and is often used as a way to help people boost their pull-up numbers or perform their first rep.
Benefits

    Strengthens the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), biceps, upper back, core, and grip
    Requires no equipment other than a bar and a band
    Can help you perform pull-ups in higher rep ranges, such as 8-15 reps per set or more
    Can help someone build up to their first pull-up, particularly if programmed alongside negative pull-up
    Simple alternative to lat pull-downs if a machine isn't available

    Choke the band around the center of the pullup bar. You can use different bands to provide varying levels of assistance.
    Pull the end of the band down, and place one bent knee into the loop, ensuring it won't slip out. Take a medium to wide grip on the bar. This will be your starting position.
    Pull yourself upward by contracting the lats as you flex the elbow. The elbow should be driven to your side. Pull to the front, attempting to get your chin over the bar. Avoid swinging or jerking movements.
    After a brief pause, return to the starting position.

    Stand to the side of a barbell next to its center. Bend your knees and lower your body until you are able to reach the barbell.
    Grasp the bar as if you were grabbing a briefcase (palms facing you since the bar is sideways). You may need a wrist wrap if you are using a significant amount of weight. This is your starting position.

    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the movement.

Caution: This is not an exercise that is recommended for people with lower back problems. Also, jerking motions or doing too much weight can injure your back.

Variations: The exercise can also be performed with a dumbbell as described above.

Sit-up

The sit-up is a popular bodyweight exercise focused on the abdominal muscles. It has also been used as part of military, tactical, and scholastic fitness tests for many years. It can be performed for time or reps, with the feet anchored or free, on flat ground or a bench.
Benefits

    Activates and strengthens the abs, in particular the rectus abdominis or �six-pack� muscles
    Strengthens the hip flexors in addition to abs
    Easy to progress by adding weight or performing on a decline bench

Sit-up Instructions
Sit-up muscle diagram

    Lie down on the floor placing your feet either under something that will not move or by having a partner hold them. Your legs should be bent at the knees.
    Place your hands behind your head and lock them together by clasping your fingers. This is the starting position.
    Elevate your upper body so that it creates an imaginary V-shape with your thighs. Breathe out when performing this part of the exercise.
    Once you feel the contraction for a second, lower your upper body back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    This exercise can be performed with a weighted plate being held by both arms resting on the chest. The way to perform this exercise is to cross your arms by making an X and grabbing the weighted plate. Note: Your hands will no longer be behind your head.
    This variation may be difficult to perform at first so start out using little to no weights until you feel comfortable with the movements.

    Grab a dumbbell in each hand and place your upper arms on top of the preacher bench or the incline bench. The dumbbells should be held at shoulder height and the elbows should be flexed. Hold the dumbbells with the palms of your hands facing down. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, slowly lower the dumbbells keeping the palms down until your upper arm is extended and your biceps are fully stretched.
    Now rotate your wrists once you are at the bottom of the movement so that the palms of the hands are facing up.
    As you exhale, use your biceps to curl the weights up until they are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder height. Again, remember that to ensure full contraction you need to bring that small finger higher than the thumb.
    Squeeze the biceps hard for a second at the contracted position and rotate your wrists so that the palms are facing down again.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Biceps
    Cable rope preacher hammer curl

Cable rope preacher hammer curl

The cable rope preacher hammer curl is a single-joint arm exercise that builds strength and size in the biceps using a cable stack, a preacher bench, and a rope grip. The neutral or "hammer" grip amplifies activation of both the grip and the brachialis muscles, building arm thickness. The angle of the bench also effectively removes the shoulders from the movement, largely isolating the biceps. It is generally performed for higher reps, at least 8-15 per set.
Benefits

    Cable provides constant tension throughout the movement, including at peak contraction
    Easy to quickly switch weights for dropsets
    Trains the biceps, forearms, brachialis, and brachioradialis
    Effective at building biceps thickness, helping boost the biceps "peak" from below

    Place a preacher bench about 2 feet in front of a pulley machine.
    Attach a straight bar to the low pulley.
    Sit at the preacher bench with your elbow and upper arms firmly on top of the bench pad and have someone hand you the bar from the low pulley.
    Grab the bar and fully extend your arms on top of the preacher bench pad. This will be your starting position.
    Now start pilling the weight up towards your shoulders and squeeze the biceps hard at the top of the movement. Exhale as you perform this motion. Also, hold for a second at the top.
    Now slowly lower the weight to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also use an e-z bar attachment or even a single hand bar so that you can do one arm at a time. This exercise can also be performed with barbells, dumbbells, E-Z bar, and exercise bands.

Seated Bent-Over One-Arm Dumbbell Triceps Extension Instructions
Seated Bent-Over One-Arm Dumbbell Triceps Extension muscle diagram

    Sit down at the end of a flat bench with a dumbbell in one arm using a neutral grip (palms of the hand facing you).
    Bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Make sure that you keep the head up.
    The upper arm with the dumbbell should be close to the torso and aligned with it (lifted up until it is parallel to the floor while the forearms are pointing towards the floor as the hands hold the weights). Tip: There should be a 90-degree angle between the forearms and the upper arm. This is your starting position.
    Keeping the upper arm stationary, use the triceps to lift the weight as you exhale until the forearm is parallel to the floor and the whole arm is extended. Like many other arm exercises, only the forearm moves.
    After a second contraction at the top, slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the exercise.

Variations:

    This exercise can be executed also with two arms at a time.
    Also, if you like the one arm variety, you can use a low pulley handle instead of a dumbbell for better peak contraction. In this case, the palms should be facing up (supinated grip) as opposed to the torso (neutral grip). You can also use a rope attachment however, and in this manner, you can also perform the movement with a neutral grip.

    Double Kettlebell Push Press

Double Kettlebell Push Press

The double-kettlebell push-press is a popular kettlebell movement that involves performing a press with help from the muscles of the lower body. It is preceded by a double clean at the start of each set, and optionally you can perform a clean between each rep. It can be trained in traditional strength or muscle-building rep ranges, in circuit or fat-loss training, or as part of a larger kettlebell combination or complex.
Benefits

    Allows you to press more weight than a strict military press
    Full-body training that challenges the lower body as well as the shoulders, arms, back, and core
    Cleaning the kettlebells to the rack position trains the hips, core, and back muscles

Lying oblique crunch Instructions
Lying oblique crunch muscle diagram

    Start out by lying on your right side with your legs lying on top of each other. Make sure your knees are bent a little bit.
    Place your left hand behind your head.
    Once you are in this set position, begin by moving your left elbow up as you would perform a normal crunch except this time the main emphasis is on your obliques.
    Crunch as high as you can, hold the contraction for a second and then slowly drop back down into the starting position.
    Remember to breathe in during the eccentric (lowering) part of the exercise and to breathe out during the concentric (elevation) part of the exercise.

Note: While you cannot add resistance to this exercise you can concentrate on perfect execution and slow speed.

Barbell front raise

The barbell front raise is an upper-body isolation exercise that targets the shoulders. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or higher, as part of the shoulder-focused part of any workout.
Benefits

    Adds size to the anterior deltoids
    Stronger, healthier front deltoids lend themselves to better pressing movements
    Can alter grip width based on shoulder comfort

    Type: Strength

Barbell front raise Instructions

    Adopt a pronated, shoulder-width grip on the barbell from a standing position.
    Allow your arms to hang straight down to mid thigh with the elbows extended. Your head should face forward, with your shoulders back and your chest up. Maintain a neutral spine and contract your abs to provide core support. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by flexing the shoulder, raising the weight straight out in front of you. Keep the elbows extended and the wrist neutral throughout the movement. Continue the upward movement of the arms until the barbell is just above shoulder height.
    At the top of the motion, pause briefly, and then slowly return to the starting position.

    Weighted donkey calf raise

Weighted donkey calf raise

The weighted donkey calk raise is a strength and muscle-building exercise focused on the muscles of the lower leg, most prominently the gastrocnemius muscle. While traditional donkey calf raises involved either a specific machine or carrying another person on one's back, this method uses a weight belt. It can be done in traditional muscle-building rep ranges, or for higher reps as part of lower-body training.
Benefits

    Allows heavy loading of calves with minimal equipment
    Emphasizes both stretch and contraction in the calf muscles
    Easy to add pauses or manipulate tempo to increase intensity

    Type: Strength

Weighted donkey calf raise Instructions
Weighted donkey calf raise muscle diagram

    For this exercise you will need access to a donkey calf raise machine. Start by positioning your lower back and hips under the padded lever provided. The tailbone area should be the one making contact with the pad.
    Place both of your arms on the side handles and place the balls of your feet on the calf block with the heels extending off. Align the toes forward, inward or outward, depending on the area you wish to target, and straighten the knees without locking them. This will be your starting position.
    Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
    Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: If you don't have a machine available but have access to a calf block and a sturdy object to hold on to, you can perform this using as resistance a person sitting on your lower back (around the tailbone area).

Janda Sit-Up Instructions
Janda Sit-Up muscle diagram

Note: This exercise was created by Czech exercise physiologist, Dr. Vladimir Janda and is one of the most challenging sit-up variations as it completely isolates the rectus abdominals by eliminating the hip flexors.

    Position your body on the floor in the basic sit-up position; knees to a ninety degree angle with feet flat on the floor and arms either crossed over your chest or to the sides. This will be your starting position.
    As you strongly tighten your glutes and hamstrings, fill your lungs with air and in a slow (three to six second count) ascent, slowly exhale. Tip: It is important to tighten the glutes and hamstrings as this will cause the hip flexors to be inactivated in a process called reciprocal inhibition, which basically means that opposite muscles to the contracted ones will relax.
    As you inhale, slowly go back in a controlled manner to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: The exercise can be done using a dedicated abdominal bench apparatus, having a workout partner exert pulling pressure on your calves (while you maintain your feet on the ground) or wrapping your legs over barbell and pulling back.

    Place your sled on an appropriate surface, loaded to a suitable weight. The sled should provide enough resistance to require effort, but not so heavy that you are significantly slowed down.
    You may use the upright or the low handles for this exercise. Place your hands on the handles with your arms extended, leaning into the implement.
    With good posture, drive through the ground with alternating, short steps. Move as fast as you can for a short distance.

    Sit on the end of a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso.
    Rotate the palms of the hands so that they are facing inward in a neutral position. This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the dumbbells out and up, turning the palms out as you lift and keeping your forearms in line with your outer deltoids. Tips:
    Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
    Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to the starting position as your breathe in. Remember to rotate your arms as you lower the dumbbells so that you can switch back to a neutral grip.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support.
    You can stand up while performing this exercise.
    You can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.

Close-grip hands-elevated push-up

The close-grip hands-elevated push-up is a variation on the classic push-up where the hands are placed on a bench or other elevated surface. Having the hands higher than the feet makes it easier than close-grip push-ups on the floor, but also puts the emphasis more on the triceps. It can be used as a substitute for floor push-ups or close-grip push-ups, or as a mechanical dropset after maxing out on floor push-ups.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the triceps and chest muscles
    Effective substitution for close-grip push-ups in any workout
    Great for burnout sets at the end of a chest or triceps workout

Barbell Squat To A Bench Instructions
Barbell Squat To A Bench muscle diagram

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first place a flat bench or a box behind you. The flat bench is used to teach you to set your hips back and to hit depth.

    Then, set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.

    Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.

    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).

    Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting your hips back as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.

    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.

    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.

Variations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.

You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.

Dumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides. The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used. I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats. (Note: For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).

Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.

    Sit on an Incline Bench while holding a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs.
    Lift your legs up to kick the weights to your shoulders and lean back. Position the dumbbells above your shoulders with your arms extended. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor with your palms facing forward and knuckles pointing towards the ceiling. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping the arms straight and locked, lift the dumbbells by raising the shoulders from the bench as you breathe out.
    Bring back the dumbbells to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can use a barbell or a smith machine in order to perform this exercise.

Standing Inner-Biceps Curl Instructions
Standing Inner-Biceps Curl muscle diagram

    Stand up with a dumbbell in each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso. Your legs should be at about shoulder's width apart from each other.
    Rotate the palms of the hands so that they are facing inward in a neutral position. This will be your starting position.
    While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights out while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Your wrist should turn so that when the weights are fully elevated you have supinated grip (palms facing up).
    Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Tip: Keep the forearms aligned with your outer deltoids.
    Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
    Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to the starting position as your breathe in. Remember to rotate the wrists as you lower the weight in order to switch back to a neutral grip.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

    There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support.
    You can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.

    Single-arm kettlebell swing

Single-arm kettlebell swing

The single-arm kettlebell swing is a popular exercise emphasizing the muscles of the hamstrings, glutes, and back. Because you are only swinging with one arm at a time, it is also uniquely challenging to the grip and core muscles. It is often used to train explosive power, for aerobic or cardiovascular conditioning, or in circuit training.
Benefits

    Trains hip, glute, back, grip, and core strength
    Burns calories and creates a cardiovascular challenge
    Can be trained with lighter weights for endurance, medium weights for power, or heavy weights for strength
    Challenging to the core because the body has to resist rotation during single-arm swings

    Type: Strength

Swing the kettlebell between your legs forcefully. Quickly reverse the direction and drive though with your hipstaking the kettlebell straight out. Let the kettlebell swing back between your legs and repeat. Switch arms with each set.

    Begin standing a few feet in front of a low pulley with a rope or handle attached. Face away from the machine, straddling the cable, with your feet set wide apart.
    Begin the movement by reaching through your legs as far as possible, bending at the hips. Keep your knees slightly bent. Keeping your arms straight, extend through the hip to stand straight up. Avoid pulling upward through the shoulders; all of the motion should originate through the hips.

    Leg Pull-In

Leg Pull-In

The reverse crunch is a popular exercise targeting the abdominals, particularly the lower half. It�s easy to perform on either the floor or a flat bench. Many lifters think of this as a companion to the crunch, which targets the upper abdominals more than the lower.
Benefits

    Suitable for beginners
    Great high-rep burnout move for abs
    Targets the lower abdominals

    Lie on an exercise mat with your legs extended and your hands either palms facing down next to you or under your glutes. Tip: My preference is with the hands next to me. This will be your starting position.
    Bend your knees and pull your upper thighs into your midsection as you breathe out. Continue the motion until your knees are around chest level. Contract your abs as you execute this movement and hold for a second at the top. Tip: As you perform the motion, the lower legs (calves) should always remain parallel to the floor.
    Return to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can hold a dumbbell between your feet to add resistance or you can also use an ankle attachment to add weight via a low pulley machine. Alternatively, you may also use exercise bands.

    Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie with your torso bent at the waist facing forward around 30-45 degrees (since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment) with the pad of the lever on the back of your right leg (just a few inches under the calves) and the front of the right leg on top of the machine pad.
    Keeping the torso bent forward, ensure your leg is fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight. This will be your starting position.
    As you exhale, curl your right leg up as far as possible without lifting the upper leg from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.
    As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Perform the same exercise now for the left leg.

    Lying cable chest fly

Lying cable chest fly

The lying cable chest fly is an isolation movement that uses a cable stack and a flat bench to build bigger and stronger pectoral muscles. It is common in upper-body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, often as a pre-exhaust at the beginning of a workout or as a finishing movement at the end. It is often used in combination with other presses or flyes to target the chest from different angles.
Benefits

    Unlike dumbbells, cables provide constant tension, including at peak contraction
    Being able to push your torso down against the bench can allow you to focus on the mind-muscle connection and move slightly more weight
    Stretches the chest muscles under load which can lead to greater muscle gain

Lying cable chest fly Instructions
Lying cable chest fly muscle diagram

    Position a flat bench between two low pulleys so that when you are laying on it, your chest will be lined up with the cable pulleys.
    Lay flat on the bench and keep your feet on the ground.
    Have someone hand you the handles on each hand. You will grab each single handle attachment with a palms up grip.
    Extend your arms by your side with a slight bend on your elbows. Tip: You will keep this bend constant through the whole movement. Your arms should be parallel to the floor. This is your starting position.
    Now start lifting the arms in a semi-circle motion directly in front of you by pulling the cables together until both hands meet at the top of the movement. Squeeze your chest as you perform this motion and breathe out during this movement. Also, hold the contraction for a second at the top. Tip: When performed correctly, at the top position of this movement, your arms should be perpendicular to your torso and the floor touching above your chest.
    Slowly come back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: Can also be done on an incline or decline bench, or with dumbbells or an exercise band.

    Single-arm pull-down

Single-arm pull-down

The single-arm pull-down is a variation on the lat pull-down that is performed one arm at a time, usually with a D-shaped handle and a cable stack. Many lifters find they can feel the lat (latissimus dorsi) muscles working better with single-arm variations.
Benefits

    Targets the latissimus dorsi muscles
    Hits more of the lower-lat muscle fibers than the bar handle version
    Allows for greater range of motion than the bar handle version

    Select an appropriate weight and adjust the knee pad to help keep you down. Grasp the handle with a pronated grip. This will be your starting position.
    Pull the handle down, squeezing your elbow to your side as you flex the elbow.
    Pause at the bottom of the motion, and then slowly return the handle to the starting position.
    For multiple repetitions, avoid completely returning the weight to keep tension on the muscles being worked.

Dumbbell Walking Lunge Instructions
Dumbbell Walking Lunge muscle diagram

    Begin standing with your feet about hip-width apart and holding dumbbells in your hands down by your side. This will be your starting position.
    Step forward with one leg, flexing the knees to drop your hips. Descend until your rear knee nearly touches the ground. Your posture should remain upright, and your front knee should be in line with your front foot. Do not allow your front knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint.
    Drive through the heel of your lead foot and extend both knees to raise yourself back up.
    Step forward with your rear foot, repeating the lunge on the opposite leg.

    Suspended push-up

Suspended push-up

The suspended push-up is a bodyweight pushing exercise performed on a suspension strap system or gymnastic rings. It targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps, but is also challenging to the core and upper back. It can work in traditional strength and muscle-building rep ranges or for higher reps.
Benefits

    Instability from rings increases challenge to pectorals and triceps
    Greater range of motion and stretch than push-ups on floor
    Simple way to make push-ups more difficult and perform them in lower rep ranges
    Surprisingly intense core work
    Difficulty level can easily be changed by raising or lowering the straps

Suspended push-up Instructions

    Anchor your suspension straps securely to the top of a rack or other object.
    Leaning into the straps, take a handle in each hand and move into a push-up plank position. You should be as close to parallel to the ground as you can manage with your arms fully extended, maintaining good posture.
    Maintaining a straight, rigid torso, descend slowly by allowing the elbows to flex.
    Continue until your elbows break 90 degrees, pausing before you extend to return to the starting position.

One Arm Floor Press Instructions
One Arm Floor Press muscle diagram

    Lie down on a flat surface with your back pressing against the floor or an exercise mat. Make sure your knees are bent.
    Have a partner hand you the bar on one hand. When starting, your arm should be just about fully extended, similar to the starting position of a barbell bench press. However, this time your grip will be neutral (palms facing your torso).
    Make sure the hand you are not using to lift the weight is placed by your side.
    Begin the exercise by lowering the barbell until your elbow touches the ground. Make sure to breathe in as this is the eccentric (lowering part of the exercise).
    Then start lifting the barbell back up to the original starting position. Remember to breathe out during the concentric (lifting part of the exercise).
    Repeat until you have performed your recommended repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the movement.

Variations: You can also perform this exercise using dumbbells. By using dumbbells you will be able to isolate your chest and add some variety to your workouts.

Caution: When you are done, do not drop the barbell or dumbbell next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you. A better way to do this is to use both of your hands to grab the barbell or dumbbell and place it to your side. Simply move the barbell or dumbbell away from the arm you are exercising before dropping the weights. This will ensure optimal safety and prevent any injuries.

    Lie down on a decline bench with both legs securely locked in position. Reach for the barbell behind the head using a pronated grip (palms facing out). Make sure to grab the barbell wider than shoulder width apart for this exercise. Slowly lift the barbell up from the floor by using your arms.
    When positioned properly, your arms should be fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. This is the starting position.
    Begin by moving the barbell back down in a semicircular motion as if you were going to place it on the floor, but instead, stop when the arms are parallel to the floor. Tip: Keep the arms fully extended at all times. The movement should only happen at the shoulder joint. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Now bring the barbell up while exhaling until you are back at the starting position. Remember to keep full control of the barbell at all times.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.
    When finished with your set, slowly lower the barbell back down until it is level with your head and release it.

Caution: It is a good idea to have a spotter for this exercise.

Variations: You can also use an EZ bar or dumbbells to perform this movement.

    Feet-elevated crunch

Feet-elevated crunch

The feet-elevated crunch is a variation on the basic crunch, a very popular ab move. Resting the feet on a bench takes some of the hip flexor activation out of the movement, focusing the stress more on the abs. It may have a small range of motion, but this movement produces a major burn.
Benefits

    Elevating your feet forces your abs to handle a greater percentage of the load
    Great burnout during an ab workout
    Great for isolating the rectus abdominis or "six-pack" muscles
    Can be performed using a couch or any other elevated surface

    Type: Strength

Feet-elevated crunch muscle diagram

    Lie flat on your back with your feet resting on an exercise ball and your knees bent at a 90 degree angle.
    Place your feet three to four inches apart and point your toes inward so they touch.
    Place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Don't lock your fingers behind your head.
    Push the small of your back down in the floor in order to better isolate your abdominal muscles. This will be your starting position.
    Begin to roll your shoulders off the floor and continue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back. Your shoulders should come up off the floor only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the floor. Breathe out as you execute this portion of the movement. Squeeze your abdominals hard at the top of the contraction and hold for a second. Tip: Focus on a slow, controlled movement. Refrain from using momentum at any time.
    Slowly go back down to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: For the most advanced lifters, a weighted plate can be held in your hands.

Smith machine upright row

The Smith machine upright row is an upper-body exercise targeting the muscles of the traps and shoulders. This movement is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.
Benefits

    Adds size and definition to the deltoids and traps
    Easy to customize hand position to where the shoulders are most comfortable
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to get into position and control

Smith machine upright row Instructions
Smith machine upright row muscle diagram

    To begin, set the bar on the smith machine to a height that is around the middle of your thighs. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, grasp the bar using a pronated (palms forward) grip that is shoulder width apart. You may need some wrist wraps if using a significant amount of weight.
    Lift the barbell up and fully extend your arms with your back straight. There should be a slight bend at the elbows. This is the starting position.
    Use your side shoulders to lift the bar as you exhale. The bar should be close to the body as you move it up. Continue to lift it until it nearly touches your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the bar, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.
    Lower the bar back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a barbell, E-Z bar, straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using dumbbells, though this later exercise should be reserved by the most advanced people that are well familiarized with correct execution.

Same as the Upright Barbell Row but with a Smith Machine.

    Smith Machine Decline Press

Smith Machine Decline Press

The Smith machine decline bench press is a machine-based exercise targeting the chest muscles, particularly the lower pectoral muscles. The Smith machine mimics a barbell but provides more stability. This movement is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a chest or upper-body workout.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the pecs
    Targets the lower chest
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to get into position and control
    May be more shoulder-friendly than a flat bench for certain lifters

    Position a decline bench in the rack so that the bar will be above your chest. Load an appropriate weight and take your place on the bench.
    Rotate the bar to unhook it from the rack and fully extend your arms. Your back should be slightly arched and your shoulder blades retracted. This will be your starting position.
    Begin the movement by flexing your arms, lowering the bar to your chest.
    Pause briefly, and then extend your arms to push the weight back to the starting position.
    After completing the desired number of repetitions, rotate the bar to rack the weight.

Smith Machine Reverse Calf Raises Instructions
Smith Machine Reverse Calf Raises muscle diagram

    Adjust the barbell on the smith machine to fit your height and align a raised platform right under the bar.
    Stand on the platform with the heels of your feet secured on top of it with the balls of your feet extending off it. Position your toes facing forward with a shoulder width stance.
    Now, place your shoulders under the barbell while maintaining the foot positioning described and push the barbell up by extending your hips and knees until your torso is standing erect. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Tip: The barbell on your back is only for balance purposes.
    Raise the balls of your feet as you breathe out by extending your toes as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position for a second before you start to go back down.
    Slowly go back down to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering the balls of your feet and toes.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also have someone place a dumbbell in between your feet for resistance. You can also perform this exercise using a doorstep and you can use the sides of the door frame for balance.

If you change the position of the platform by putting it forward or backwards, it will emphasize the higher or lower calf. Similarly, the stance you use can affect where it hits; the closer your feet are, the more the sides will be isolated, whereas the further apart your feet are, the more the front tibialis will be targeted.

    Single-dumbbell push-up

Single-dumbbell push-up

The single-dumbbell push-up is a more difficult push-up variation where you balance your hands on the ends of a dumbbell. This simple change makes many muscle groups work harder, helping encourage muscle and strength gains across the upper body.
Benefits

    Simple way to make push-ups more difficult or combine them with dumbbell movements in circuit training
    Additional shoulder, chest, and core activation due to instability of dumbbell
    Narrow grip increases the challenge to the triceps

    Lie on the floor and place your hands on an upright dumbbell. Supporting your weight on your toes and hands, keep your torso rigid and your elbows in with your arms straight. This will be your starting position.
    Lower your body, allowing the elbows to flex while you inhale. Keep your body straight, not allowing your hips to rise or sag.
    Press yourself back up to the starting position by extending the elbows. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    After a pause at the contracted position, repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

    Overhead bar front raise

Overhead bar front raise

The overhead bar front raise is an exercise targeting the muscles of the traps (trapezius), especially the upper traps, as well as the front or anterior shoulders. It can also be performed with a weight plate or dumbbell, providing a neutral grip that may be more shoulder-friendly for some lifters. Overhead raises are most common for high reps (at least 8-12 reps per set or higher) on a shoulder, trap, or other upper-body-focused muscle-building day.
Benefits

    Strengthens and activates the traps, shoulders, and upper-back muscles
    Can also be done for super-high reps, such as 50-100 per set, with a light weight as a burnout
    Using a bar allows for different grip widths based on what feels best for an individual's shoulders

Overhead bar front raise Instructions
Overhead bar front raise muscle diagram

    To begin, stand straight with a barbell in your hands. You should grip the bar with palms facing down and a closer than shoulder width grip apart from each other.
    Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. Your elbows should be slightly bent. This is the starting position.
    Lift the barbell up until it is directly over your head while exhaling. Make sure to keep your elbows slightly bent when performing each repetition.
    Once you feel the contraction, begin to lower the barbell back down to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed with dumbbells in each hand or by using a close or wide grip with the barbell. By alternating the widths of your grip, you will be able to contract different parts of the shoulders for an overall better physique.

Weighted Squat Instructions
Weighted Squat muscle diagram

    Start by positioning two flat benches shoulder width apart from each other. Stand on top of them and wrap the weighted belt around your waist with the amount of weight you feel comfortable with. Make sure your toes are facing out.
    Once you are standing straight up with the weight hanging in between your legs, position your arms so that they are fully extended to the side of your body. This is the starting position.
    Begin by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that are perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
    Begin to move the body back up by pushing the floor of the flat bench with the ball of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Exhale as you perform this portion of the exercise.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: Instead of using flat benches, you can use any other sort of raised platforms as long as they are sturdy and safe to use.

    Lie on incline an bench facing away from a high pulley machine that has a straight bar attachment on it.

    Slowly go back to the starting position using your lats and hold the contraction once you reach the starting position. Breathe out during the execution of this movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also use an angled attachment or a rope attachment as well. Finally, you can perform one arm at a time by using a single handle attachment.

    Counter that movement by swinging your legs forward and up, jerking your chin and chest back, pulling yourself up with both arms as you do so. As you reach the top position of the pull-up, pull the rings to your armpits as you roll your shoulders forward, allowing your elbows to move straight back behind you. This puts you into the proper position to continue into the dip portion of the movement.
    Maintaining control and stability, extend through the elbow to complete the motion.
    Use care when lowering yourself to the ground.

Reverse Plate Curls Instructions
Reverse Plate Curls muscle diagram

    Start by standing straight with a weighted plate held by both hands and arms fully extended. Use a pronated grip (palms facing down) and make sure your fingers grab the rough side of the plate while your thumb grabs the smooth side. Note: For the best results, grab the weighted plate at an 11:00 and 1:00 o'clock position.
    Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other and the weighted plate should be near the groin area. This is the starting position.
    Slowly lift the plate up while keeping the elbows in and the upper arms stationary until your biceps and forearms touch while exhaling. The plate should be evenly aligned with your torso at this point.
    Feel the contraction for a second and begin to lower the weight back down to the starting position while inhaling
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Clean Pull Instructions
Clean Pull muscle diagram

    With a barbell on the floor close to the shins, take an overhand or hook grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.
    Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight and elbows out. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.
    Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended. Full extension should be violent and abrupt, and ensure that you do not prolong the extension for longer than necessary.

    Lying Close-Grip Bar Curl On High Pulley

Lying Close-Grip Bar Curl On High Pulley

The lying high-cable biceps curl is an unusual move for building the biceps�but it�s a highly effective one. Lying prone and curling down toward you provides a different stimulus than more standard approaches allow.
Benefits

    Builds bigger and stronger biceps
    Easy to maintain continuous tension throughout the move
    Great for hitting the short (inner) head of the biceps

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Biceps

Lying Close-Grip Bar Curl On High Pulley Instructions
Lying Close-Grip Bar Curl On High Pulley muscle diagram

    Place a flat bench in front of a high pulley or lat pulldown machine.
    Hold the straight bar attachment using an underhand grip (palms up) that is about shoulder width.
    Lie on your back with your head over the end of the bench.
    Now extend your arms straight above your shoulders. Your torso and your arms should make a 90-degree angle and the elbows should be in. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe out, curl the bar down in a semicircular motion until it touches your chin. Squeeze the biceps for a second at the top contracted position. Tip: As you execute this motion only the forearms should move. At no time should the upper arms be moving at all. They are to remain perpendicular throughout the movement.
    Return to starting position slowly.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also curl down to above your head, rather than to your chin or use an E-Z Bar Attachment instead of a straight one.

    Behind-the-neck pull-down

Behind-the-neck pull-down

The behind-the-neck pull-down is a cable exercise intended to target the muscles of the upper and middle back. If you have the requisite shoulder mobility, it can help you target the upper back muscles, including the trapezius and rhomboids, as well as the lats (latissimus dorsi). It is popular among elite bodybuilders and physique athletes, but some coaches consider it unsafe to the shoulder joint, particularly for people with existing shoulder problems.
Benefits

    Targets the rhomboids and lower trapezius, two important postural muscles
    Can help build or preserve shoulder mobility, if you have adequate mobility to perform the movement
    Cable provides constant tension throughout the movement, including at peak contraction
    Can be done light for high reps or in traditional muscle-building rep ranges (8-15)

Behind-the-neck pull-down Instructions
Behind-the-neck pull-down muscle diagram

    Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
    Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.
    As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso and head forward. Think of an imaginary line from the center of the bar down to the back of your neck. This is your starting position.
    As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches the back of your neck by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.
    After a second on the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.
    Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

Caution: Performing this exercise can be hard on the rotator cuffs and if not properly executed can cause an injury to occur. Also, if you already have rotator cuff issues, I advise you to stick to the front pull-down version.

Variations: You can also performing this exercise by bring the bar down and touching your chest. This variation is safer and not as hard on the rotator cuffs.

Seated leg tuck Instructions
Seated leg tuck muscle diagram

    Sit on a bench with the legs stretched out in front of you slightly below parallel and your arms holding on to the sides of the bench. Your torso should be leaning backwards around a 45-degree angle from the bench. This will be your starting position.
    Bring the knees in toward you as you move your torso closer to them at the same time. Breathe out as you perform this movement.
    After a second pause, go back to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also perform this exercise on a mat on the floor just by placing your arms to the sides. In this case, the legs will be stretched and elevated slightly over the floor. Also, as you become more advanced you can hold a dumbbell in between your feet or attach a pulley to them for added resistance. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise as if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia.

Incline cable straight-bar triceps extension

The incline cable straight-bar triceps extension is a single-joint arm exercise performed on an incline bench. This incline position offers a great stretch and range of motion, potentially targeting the long head of the triceps more than some other triceps exercises. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of the arm-focused portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Builds strength and size in the triceps
    Great burnout movement for triceps at low weight
    The cables provide constant tension on the muscles
    Targets the long head of the triceps

Incline cable straight-bar triceps extension muscle diagram

    Lie on incline an bench facing away from a high pulley machine that has a straight bar attachment on it.
    Grasp the straight bar attachment overhead with a pronated (overhand; palms down) narrow grip (less than shoulder width) and keep your elbows tucked in to your sides. Your upper arms should create around a 25 degree angle when measured from the floor.
    Keeping the upper arms stationary, extend the arms as you flex the triceps. Breathe out during this portion of the movement and hold the contraction for a second.
    Slowly go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also use an angled attachment or a rope attachment as well. Finally, you can perform one arm at a time by using a single handle attachment.

    To begin, lie down with your back pressed against the floor or on an exercise mat (optional). Your arms should be fully extended to the sides with your palms facing down. Note: The arms should be stationary the entire time.
    With a slight bend at the knees, lift your legs up so that your heels are about 6 inches off the ground. This is the starting position.
    Now lift your left leg up to about a 45 degree angle while your right leg is lowered until the heel is about 2-3 inches from the ground.
    Switch movements by raising your right leg up and lowering your left leg. Remember to breathe while performing this exercise.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: As you get more advanced, you can wear ankle weights for resistance.

    Smith machine pistol squat

Smith machine pistol squat

The Smith machine pistol squat is a machine-based exercise that targets the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. It is similar in form to a pistol squat but is performed with a bar on the shoulders. This adds extra resistance, but also eliminates some of the balance challenge of single-leg squats. This squat variation can be performed in low reps for strength or for higher reps for muscle gain.
Benefits

    Strengthens the legs, core, and upper back
    Helps with imbalances in strength and size between legs
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to get into position and control

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps

    To begin, first set the bar to a position that best matches your height. Step under it and position the bar across the back of your shoulders.
    Take the bar with your hands facing forward, unlock it and lift it off the rack by extending your legs.3
    Move one foot forward about 12 inches in front of the bar. Extend the other leg out in front of you, holding it off the ground. Look forward at all times and maintain a neutral or slightly arched spine. This will be your starting position.
    Maintaining good posture, lower yourself by flexing the knee and hip, going down as far as flexibility allows.
    Pause briefly at the bottom and then return to the starting position by driving through the heel of your foot, extending the knee and hip.

Dumbbell Squat To A Bench Instructions
Dumbbell Squat To A Bench muscle diagram

    Stand up straight with a flat bench behind you while holding a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing the side of your legs).
    Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.
    Begin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. You may use wrist wraps for this exercise.

Variations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.

You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.

You can also use a barbell for this exercise. Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.

    Attach a climbing rope to a high beam or cross member. Below it, ensure that the smith machine bar is locked in place with the safeties and cannot move. Alternatively, a secure box could also be utilized.
    Stand on the bar, using the rope to balance yourself. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your body straight, lean back and lower your body by slowly going hand over hand with the rope. Continue until you are perpendicular to the ground.
    Keeping your body straight, reverse the motion, going hand over hand back to the starting position.

    Smith machine stiff-legged deadlift

Smith machine stiff-legged deadlift

The Smith machine stiff-legged deadlift is a machine-based exercise targeting the muscles of the hamstrings, glutes, and upper back. The Smith machine mimics a barbell but provides more stability. This movement can be programmed like a traditional stiff-legged or Romanian deadlift, in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle and strength endurance. It is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a full-body or lower-body workout.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the hamstrings and glutes
    Works the upper back, lower back, and core to maintain a neutral back position
    Allows you to press your hips back and emphasize the stretch
    The bar moves on a track making it easier to get into position and control

Smith machine stiff-legged deadlift muscle diagram

    To begin, set the bar on the smith machine to a height that is around the middle of your thighs. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, grasp the bar using a pronated (palms forward) grip that is shoulder width apart. You may need some wrist wraps if using a significant amount of weight.
    Lift the bar up by fully extending your arms while keeping your back straight. Stand with your torso straight and your legs spaced using a shoulder width or narrower stance. The knees should be slightly bent. This is your starting position.
    Keeping the knees stationary, lower the barbell to over the top of your feet by bending at the waist while keeping your back straight. Keep moving forward as if you were going to pick something from the floor until you feel a stretch on the hamstrings. Exhale as you perform this movement
    Start bringing your torso up straight again as soon as you feel the hamstrings stretch by extending your hips and waist until you are back at the starting position. Inhale as you perform this movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is not an exercise that is recommended for people with lower back problems. Also, it needs to be treated with the utmost respect paying special attention not to round the back forward as you move the torso down; the back should always be straight. Finally, jerking motions or doing too much weight can injure your back.

Variations: The exercise can also be performed with dumbbells or a straight bar.

Like the Stiff-Legged Deadlift but with a Smith Machine.

Pin Presses Instructions
Pin Presses muscle diagram

    Pin presses remove the eccentric phase of the bench press, developing starting strength. They also allow you to train a desired range of motion.
    The bench should be set up in a power rack. Set the pins to the desired point in your range of motion, whether it just be lockout or an inch off of your chest. The bar should be moved to the pins and prepared for lifting.
    Begin by lying on the bench, with the bar directly above the contact point during your regular bench. Tuck your feet underneath you and arch your back. Using the bar to help support your weight, lift your shoulder off the bench and retract them, squeezing the shoulder blades together. Use your feet to drive your traps into the bench. Maintain this tight body position throughout the movement.
    You can take a standard bench grip, or shoulder width to focus on the triceps. The bar, wrist, and elbow should stay in line at all times. Focus on squeezing the bar and trying to pull it apart.
    Drive the bar up with as much force as possible. The elbows should be tucked in until lockout.
    Return the bar to the pins, pausing before beginning the next repetition.

    Landmine Linear Jammer

Landmine Linear Jammer

The linear jammer is an explosive pressing movement performed using an angled barbell anchored at floor level in a landmine device. It can also be performed by sticking a barbell in the corner of a room, preferably in a towel to protect the walls. The linear jammer involves pressing the weight into the air, then catching it with the other hand. The movement focuses primarily on the muscles of the shoulders or deltoids. It can be trained in traditional muscle and strength-focused rep ranges, for lower reps with a focus on explosive pressing power, or for higher reps.
Benefits

    May be more shoulder-friendly than explosive bench or overhead presses
    Intense stabilization challenge to the core
    Trains eccentric strength in the shoulder muscles
    Single-arm training focuses on each side individually, addressing potential imbalances

    In an athletic stance, squat by flexing your hips and setting your hips back, keeping your arms flexed.
    Reverse the motion by powerfully extending through the hips, knees, and ankles, while also extending the elbows to straighten the arms. This movement should be done explosively, coming out of the squat to full extension as powerfully as possible.
    Return to the starting position.

    Quadriceps
    Barbell squat with plate slide

Barbell squat with plate slide

The barbell squat with plate slide is an exercise targeting the quadriceps, with the plate slide also working the adductors and abductors. It can help you get more total-leg and hip development out of squats, but is probably not the sort of thing you want to do with a seriously heavy load on your back.
Benefits

    Builds and strengthens the quadriceps
    Also works the adductors and abductors
    Extra hip work may help improve squat form

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Quadriceps
    Equipment: Other

    To begin, first set the bar on a rack to just below shoulder level. Position a weight plate on the ground a couple feet back from the rack. Once the bar is loaded, step under it and place the back of your shoulders across it.
    Hold on to the bar with both hands and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straighten your torso.
    Step away from the rack and adopt a wide stance with the toes slightly pointed out, with one foot on the weight plate. Keep your head up at all times. This will be your starting position.
    Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and hips. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees.
    Raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heels of your feet as you extend the hips and knees.
    At the top of the movement, side step, bringing your feet together on the opposite side of the plate.
    Using your inside foot, push the weight plate, sliding it across the floor to where you were just standing.
    Place your inside foot on the weight plate, adopting a wide stance for the next repetition.

    Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over your neck with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
    As you breathe in, bring the bar down slowly until it is about 1 inch from your neck.
    After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.

Caution:

    It is advised that you use a spotter for this exercise. If no spotter is available, then be very conservative with the amount of weight used.
    Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to be about 1 inch from your neck and nowhere else.
    You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.

Variations: This exercise can also be performed with the smith machine.

    Piriformis SMR

Piriformis SMR

Piriformis self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment for the lower body, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other "trigger point" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the piriformis muscles in the upper gluteal region, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight muscle to relax or "release." Piriformis SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the iliotibial (IT) band or tensor fascia lata (TFL muscles), or by stretches that target the glutes and hips.
Benefits

    Can encourage blood flow to the glute muscles
    May be able to temporarily increase range of motion in the hip joints
    Effective as part of a warm-up or post-workout recovery

    Type: Stretching
    Main Muscle Worked: Glutes

    Sit with your buttocks on top of a foam roll. Bend your knees, and then cross one leg so that the ankle is over the knee. This will be your starting position.
    Shift your weight to the side of the crossed leg, rolling over the buttocks until you feel tension in your upper glute. You may assist the stretch by using one hand to pull the bent knee towards your chest. Hold this position for 10-30 seconds, and then switch sides.

    Stand in the middle of two low pulleys that are opposite to each other and place a flat bench right behind you (in perpendicular fashion to you; the narrow edge of the bench should be the one behind you). Select the weight to be used on each pulley.
    Now sit at the edge of the flat bench behind you with your feet placed in front of your knees.
    Bend forward while keeping your back flat and rest your torso on the thighs.
    Have someone give you the single handles attached to the pulleys. Grasp the left pulley with the right hand and the right pulley with the left after you select your weight. The pulleys should run under your knees and your arms will be extended with palms facing each other and a slight bend at the elbows. This will be the starting position.
    While keeping the arms stationary, raise the upper arms to the sides until they are parallel to the floor and at shoulder height. Exhale during the execution of this movement and hold the contraction for a second.
    Slowly lower your arms to the starting position as you inhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Tip: Maintain upper arms perpendicular to torso and a fixed elbow position (10 degree to 30 degree angle) throughout exercise.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with exercise bands or dumbbells.

One-Arm Flat Bench Dumbbell Flye Instructions
One-Arm Flat Bench Dumbbell Flye muscle diagram

    Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in one hand resting on top of your thigh. The palm of your hand with the dumbbell in it should be at a neutral grip.
    By using your thighs to help you get the dumbbell up, clean the dumbbell so that you can hold it in front of you with your lifting arm being fully extended. Remember to maintain a neutral grip with this exercise. Your non lifting hand should be to the side holding the flat bench for better support. This will be your starting position.
    Your arm with the weight should have a slight bend on your elbow in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon. Begin by lowering your arm with the weight in it out in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, your lifting arm should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.
    Return your lifting arm back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.
    Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the exercise.

Variations: You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation.

    Quadriceps
    Suspended split squat

Suspended split squat

The suspended split squat is a single-leg squat variation performed with the rear leg in a suspension strap system. This allows the rear leg to move slightly more naturally than it would be able to on a bench. The exercise targets the quads, hamstring, and glute muscles on the front leg, but also taxes and stretches the quads on the rear leg.
Benefits

    Builds strength and muscle in the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    Builds active flexibility in the quads and hip flexors
    Can alter tempo or add pauses to make more difficult
    If balance is a challenge, exercise is still effective holding onto something for support

    Suspend your straps so the handles are 18-30 inches from the floor.
    Facing away from the setup, place your rear foot into the handle behind you. Keep your head looking forward and your chest up, with your knee slightly bent. This will be your starting position.
    Descend by flexing the knee and hips, lowering yourself to the ground. Keep your weight on the heel of your foot and maintain your posture throughout the exercise.
    At the bottom of the movement, reverse the motion, extending through the hip and knee to return to the starting position.

    Incline barbell shoulder protraction

Incline barbell shoulder protraction

The incline barbell shoulder protraction is an upper-body movement that targets strength and mobility in the scapula or shoulder blades. This can help increase pressing strength and prevent injury. It also helps develop the serratus anterior, an often-neglected muscle around the ribcage that can aid in shoulder health and upper-body muscle definition. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.
Benefits

    Teaches how to move the scapula for good form during upper-body exercises
    Builds the serratus anterior, the muscle responsible for stabilizing the scapula
    Great prehab for shoulders

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Shoulders

    Lie back on an Incline Bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that is slightly wider than shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms straight. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping the arms straight, lift the bar by protracting your shoulder blades, raising the shoulders from the bench as you breathe out.
    Bring back the bar to the starting position as you breathe in.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can use dumbbells or a smith machine in order to perform this exercise.

Standing Towel Triceps Extension Instructions
Standing Towel Triceps Extension muscle diagram

    To begin, stand up with both arms fully extended above the head holding one end of a towel with both hands. Your elbows should be in and the arms perpendicular to the floor with the palms facing each other while your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position.
    Now communicate with your partner so that he/she can grip the other side of the towel to apply resistance. Keeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.
    Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the towel. Breathe out as you perform this step.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: Make sure your partner does not apply to much resistance or suddenly jerks the towel as doing so could cause injury. Start out by having your partner applying barely any resistance so you can get used to the exercise. As you practice the exercise, then your partner can gradually begin to increase the resistance of the exercise.

Variation: You can perform this exercise with one arm at a time or even sitting down for more back support.

    To begin, lie down on an exercise ball with your left side of the torso (waist, hips and shoulder) pressed against the ball.
    Your feet should be on the floor while your legs are crossed and hanging from the ball. Hold a weighted plate with your right hand directly to the right side of your head. Tip: Make sure the smooth side of the plate is resting against your head.
    Place your left arm across your torso so that your palm is on your obliques. There should be a right angle between your left forearm and upper arm. This is the starting position.
    Raise the side of your torso up by laterally flexing at the waist while exhaling.
    Hold the contraction for a second and slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position while inhaling.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    Switch sides and repeat the exercise.

Caution: If new to this exercise it is best to perform it without any weights until you develop good form.

    With your head and neck in a neutral position (normal position with head erect facing forward), place both of your hands on the front side of your head.
    Now gently push forward as you contract the neck muscles but resisting any movement of your head. Start with slow tension and increase slowly. Keep breathing normally as you execute this contraction.
    Hold for the recommended number of seconds.

Atlas Stone Trainer Instructions
Atlas Stone Trainer muscle diagram

    This trainer is effective for developing Atlas Stone strength for those who don't have access to stones, and are typically made from bar ends or heavy pipe.
    Begin by loading the desired weight onto the bar. Straddle the weight, wrapping your arms around the implement, bending at the hips.
    Begin by pulling the weight up past the knees, extending through the hips. As the weight clears the knees, it can be lapped by resting it on your thighs and sitting back, hugging it tightly to your chest.
    Finish the movement by extending through your hips and knees to raise the weight as high as possible. The weight can be returned to the lap or to the ground for successive repetitions.

    Lie on your back with your legs extended. Your partner should be kneeling beside you. Raise one leg up towards the ceiling and have your partner hold the ankle. Your partner can use their shoulder to brace your leg if necessary. This will be your starting position.
    Have your partner push your leg toward your chest just far enough so you feel slight discomfort. Hold the stretch for 10 seconds.
    After 10 seconds, actively push back against your partner's resistance for 6 seconds.
    Then relax your leg, allowing your partner to gently push the leg towards your head. Be sure to inform your helper when the stretch is adequate to prevent injury or overstretching. Switch sides once complete.

One Arm Chin-Up Instructions
One Arm Chin-Up muscle diagram

    For this exercise, start out by placing a towel around a chin up bar.
    Grab the chin-up bar with your palm facing you. One hand will be grabbing the chin-up bar and the other will be grabbing the towel.
    Bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.v
    Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.
    After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.
    Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
    Switch arms and repeat the movement.

Variations:

    If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.
    Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.

    Barbell seal row

Barbell seal row

The barbell seal row is a weighted exercise targeting the muscles of the middle back, including the lats (latissimus dorsi) and rhomboids. It can be performed on a special elevated bench, on a bench placed on top of boxes or benches, or on a bench with a slight incline. The higher the bench, the greater the range of motion and stretch at the bottom of the movement. It is usually performed as an assistance movement for back strength and muscle growth, in rep ranges of 8-12 reps per set or higher.
Benefits

    Takes the lower body out of the row, focusing purely on the back
    Enforces strict rowing form and eliminates momentum

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Middle Back
    Equipment: Barbell

Barbell seal row Instructions
Barbell seal row muscle diagram

    Place a cambered bar underneath an exercise bench.
    Lie face down on the exercise bench and grab the bar using a palms down (pronated grip) that is wider than shoulder width. This will be your starting position.
    As you exhale row the bar up as you keep the elbows close to your body to either your chest, in order to target the upper mid back, or to your stomach if targeting the lats is your goal.
    After a second hold at the top, lower back down to the starting position slowly as you inhale.

Variations: A regular barbell can be used, but a cambered barbell gives you a greater range of motion. You can also turn this into a rear delt movement by flaring the elbows out instead of keeping them close to your torso.

Crucifix Instructions
Crucifix muscle diagram

    In the crucifix, you statically hold weights out to the side for time. While the event can be practiced using dumbbells, it is best to practice with one of the various implements used, such as axes and hammers, as it feels different.
    Begin standing, and raise your arms out to the side holding the implements. Your arms should be parallel to the ground. In competition, judges or sensors are used to let you know when you break parallel. Hold for as long as you can. Typically, the weights should be heavy enough that you fail in 30-60 seconds.

    Calves
    Calf SMR

Calf SMR

Calf self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment for the lower body, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other "trigger point" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the calf muscles of the lower leg, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight muscle to relax or "release." Calf SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the quadriceps muscles, or by stretches that target the calves.
Benefits

    Can encourage blood flow to the calf muscles
    May be able to temporarily increase range of motion in the knee joints
    Effective as part of a warm-up or post-workout recovery
    Along with stretching the calves and quadriceps, some people find it can provide temporary relief from certain types of exercise-derived knee pain

Calf SMR Instructions

    Begin seated on the floor. Place a foam roller underneath your lower leg. Your other leg can either be crossed over the opposite or be placed on the floor, supporting some of your weight. This will be your starting position.
    Place your hands to your side or just behind you, and press down to raise your hips off of the floor, placing much of your weight against your calf muscle. Roll from below the knee to above the ankle, pausing at points of tension for 10-30 seconds. Repeat for the other leg.

    Kettlebell alternating floor press

Kettlebell alternating floor press

The kettlebell alternating floor press limits the range of motion you would achieve with a dumbbell or kettlebell bench press, but still targets the chest, triceps, and anterior delts. This allows you to build strength in the top portion of the lift, overload the triceps, and work on strengthening the shoulder stabilizers.
Benefits

    Pressing from the floor with a neutral or rotating grip can take stress off the shoulder joint
    Heavier weights can be used, making it a great accessory movement for strengthening the kettlebell military press
    Takes your legs out of the movement, giving all the responsibility to the core and upper body to move the weight and build strength

    Extend both arms, so that the kettlebells are being held above your chest. Lower one kettlebell, bringing it to your chest and turn the wrist in the direction of the locked out kettlebell.
    Raise the kettlebell and repeat on the opposite side.

    After choosing a suitable band, lay down in the middle of the rack, after securing the band on either side of you. If your rack doesn't have pegs, the band can be secured using heavy dumbbells or similar objects, just ensure they won't move.
    Adjust your position so that the band is directly over your hips. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the floor. Your hands can be on the floor or holding the band in position.
    Keeping your shoulders on the ground, drive through your heels to raise your hips, pushing into the band as high as you can.
    Pause at the top of the motion, and return to the starting position.

    Begin standing while facing a wall or a partner.
    Using both hands, position the ball behind your head, stretching as much as possible, and forcefully throw the ball forward.
    Ensure that you follow your throw through, being prepared to receive your rebound from your throw. If you are throwing against the wall, make sure that you stand close enough to the wall to receive the rebound, and aim a little higher than you would with a partner.

Smith Machine Hang Power Clean muscle diagram

    Position the bar at knee height and load it to an appropriate weight.
    Take a pronated grip on the bar outside of shoulder width and unhook the bar from the machine. Your arms should be fully extended with your head and chest up. Your elbows should be pointed out with your shoulders back and down. Your hips should be back, loading the tension into the hamstrings. This will be your starting position.
    Initate the movement by forcefully extending the hips and knees, accelerating into the bar. Ensure that you keep your arms straight during this part of the motion.
    Upon full extension, rebend the hips and knees to lower your receiving position.
    Allow the arms to flex at this point, rotating the elbows around the bar to receive it on your shoulders.
    Extend through the hips and knees to come to a standing position with the bar racked on your shoulders to complete the movement.

Lying High Bench Barbell Curl Instructions
Lying High Bench Barbell Curl muscle diagram

    Lie face forward on a tall flat bench while holding a barbell with a supinated grip (palms facing up). Tip: If you are holding a barbell grab it using a shoulder-width grip and if you are using an E-Z Bar grab it on the inner handles. Your upper body should be positioned in a way that the upper chest is over the end of the bench and the barbell is hanging in front of you with the arms extended and perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position.
    While keeping the elbows in and the upper arms stationary, curl the weight up in a semi-circular motion as you contract the biceps and exhale. Hold at the top of the movement for a second.
    As you inhale, slowly go back to the starting position. Tip: Maintain full control of the weight at all times and avoid any swinging. Remember, only the forearms should move throughout the movement.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: If no tall bench is available you can opt for an adjustable bench and you can place it at an incline that allows you to have your arms fully extended without the bar touching the floor.

You can also perform the exercise using dumbbells.

    To start out, make sure that the exercise band is at an even split between both the left and right side of the body. To do this, use your hands to grab both sides of the band and place both feet in the middle of the band. Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other.
    When holding the bands, they should be the same height on each side. You should be using a pronated grip (palms facing forward) and have the handles of the bands next to your face for this exercise. This is the starting position.
    Slowly start to bend the knees and lower the legs so that your thighs are parallel to the floor while exhaling.
    Use the heel of your feet to push your body up to the starting position as you exhale.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Rhomboids SMR

Rhomboids SMR

Rhomboids self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment for the upper body, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other "trigger point" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the rhomboid muscles of the mid back, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight area to relax or "release." Rhomboids SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the lats, or by stretches that target the rhomboids or lats.
Benefits

    Can encourage blood flow to the rhomboid muscles
    Effective as part of a warm-up or post-workout recovery
    May help contribute to temporary increases in range of motion in the thoracic spine

    Using a flat bench secure a band under the leg of the bench that is nearest to your head.
    Once the band is secure, grab it by both handles and lie down on the bench.
    Extend your arms so that you are holding the band handles in front of you at shoulder width.
    Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position.
    Bring down the handles slowly until your elbow forms a 90 degree angle. Keep full control at all times.
    As you breathe out, bring the handles up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
    Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.

Variations: You can also use a pulley machine, dumbbells or a barbell for this exercise.

    Quadriceps
    Quadriceps SMR

Quadriceps SMR

Quadriceps self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment for the lower body, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other "trigger point" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the quad muscles of the upper leg, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight muscle group to relax or "release." Quadriceps SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the calf, glute, or hip muscles, or by stretches that target the calves or quads.
Benefits

    Can encourage blood flow to the quadriceps muscles, including the vastus medialis and rectus femoris
    May be able to temporarily increase range of motion in the knee joints
    Effective as part of a warm-up or post-workout recovery
    Along with stretching the calves and quadriceps, some people find it can provide temporary relief from certain types of exercise-derived knee pain

    Lay facedown on the floor with your weight supported by your hands or forearms. Place a foam roll underneath one leg on the quadriceps, and keep the foot off of the ground. Make sure to relax the leg as much as possible. This will be your starting position.
    Shifting as much weight onto the leg to be stretched as is tolerable, roll over the foam from above the knee to below the hip, holding points of tension for 10-30 seconds. Switch sides.

Front Barbell Squat To A Bench Instructions
Front Barbell Squat To A Bench muscle diagram

    This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set a flat bench behind you and set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.
    Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).
    Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you touch the bench with your glutes. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The front squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. This version of the squat is better suited for advanced athletes.

Variations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.

Partner farmer's walk Instructions
Partner farmer's walk muscle diagram

    Place two dumbbells on the floor in front of you, making sure you have enough open space to walk. If you can’t reach the floor safely without rounding your back, elevate the weights off the floor. (When doing this as a competition, start side by side with your partner and make sure there’s enough room for both of you.)
    Squat down keeping your back flat—don’t bend over—and grasp the weights with a neutral grip. Stand back up by extending at the hips and knees; this will be your starting position.
    Keeping the weights at your sides, walk forward as far as you can; if necessary turn around and return the other way. Try to beat your partner for both distance and time.
    Descend into a squat to lower the weights back to the floor.

    Arm circle

Arm circle

The arm circle is a non-weighted exercise targeting the shoulders. It involves extending your arms to the sides and drawing small circles in the air with your hands. It is common in warm-ups for both training and athletics, and is often performed simply until someone feels a burn, rather than for a set amount of reps.
Benefits

    Warms up the shoulder joints for heavier work
    Works the often neglected and frequently injured rotator cuffs
    Suitable for beginners

    Type: Stretching

    Stand up and extend your arms straight out by the sides. The arms should be parallel to the floor and perpendicular (90-degree angle) to your torso. This will be your starting position.
    Slowly start to make circles of about 1 foot in diameter with each outstretched arm. Breathe normally as you perform the movement.
    Continue the circular motion of the outstretched arms for about ten seconds. Then reverse the movement, going the opposite direction.

Tip: Ten second movements equal one set and each circle equals one repetition.

Variations: As you get stronger you can use some light resistance.

    Connect a rope attachment to a tower, and move the cable to the lowest pulley position. Stand with your side to the cable with a wide stance, and grab the rope with both hands.
    Twist your body away from the pulley as you bring the rope over your shoulder like you’re performing a judo flip.
    Shift your weight between your feet as you twist and crunch forward, pulling the cable downward.
    Return to the starting position and repeat until failure.
    Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.

Tip: Although this should be one continuous movement, think of it as two separate ab movements: the twist for obliques and the crunch for abs. This will help with the mind-muscle connection. Also, over exaggerate the end of the crunch by pausing for a moment and clinching your abs in an isometric hold before releasing.

    Exercise ball torso rotation

Exercise ball torso rotation

The exercise ball torso rotation is a rotational abdominal exercise performed while holding a yoga or exercise ball between the hands. It focuses on the rotational muscles of the core, including the obliques, glutes, and hip muscles. It can be performed one side at a time or alternating, either for time or reps. To make it more difficult, wrap a light exercise band around the ball and anchor it to a solid object.
Benefits

    Trains rotational power
    Strengthens the obliques, as well as the muscles of the hips, glutes, and middle back
    Emphasizes thoracic mobility and working beyond traditional gym-based planes of motion

Calf Raises - With Bands muscle diagram

    Grab an exercise band and stand on it with your toes making sure that the length of the band between the foot and the arms is the same for both sides.
    While holding the handles of the band, raise the arms to the side of your head as if you were getting ready to perform a shoulder press. The palms should be facing forward with the elbows bent and to the sides. This movement will create tension on the band. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping the hands by your shoulder, stand up on your toes as you exhale and contract the calves hard at the top of the movement.
    After a one second contraction, slowly go back down to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: There are multiple ways to perform calf raises. You can use dumbbells, barbells or various machines.

Calf Raise On A Dumbbell muscle diagram

    Hang on to a sturdy object for balance and stand on a dumbbell handle, preferably one with round plates so that it rolls as in this manner you have to work harder to stabilize yourself; thus increasing the effectiveness of the exercise.
    Now roll your foot slightly forward so that you can get a nice stretch of the calf. This will be your starting position.
    Lift the calf as you roll your foot over the top of the handle so that you get a full extension. Exhale during the execution of this movement. Contract the calf hard at the top and hold for a second. Tip: As you come up, roll the dumbbell slightly backward.
    Now inhale as you roll the dumbbell slightly forward as you come down to get a better stretch.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can also do these standing on the head of the dumbbell, using a large dumbbell that is wider.

    Seated bar twist

Seated bar twist

The seated bar twist is a core exercise meant to strengthen the obliques. It is often performed for high reps with relatively light weight, such as an empty barbell, a lightweight fixed-weight bar, or even a PVC pipe. It can be performed during a workout, at the end of a workout, or outside of the gym to build core strength and resiliency.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the obliques
    Builds oblique strength that carries over into any turning or bending movements
    Contributes to better core aesthetics

    Type: Strength

Seated bar twist Instructions
Seated bar twist muscle diagram

    Start out by sitting at the end of a flat bench with a barbell placed on top of your thighs. Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other.
    Grip the bar with your palms facing down and make sure your hands are wider than shoulder width apart from each other. Begin to lift the barbell up over your head until your arms are fully extended.
    Now lower the barbell behind your head until it is resting along the base of your neck. This is the starting position.
    While keeping your feet and head stationary, move your waist from side to side so that your oblique muscles feel the contraction. Only move from side to side as far as your waist will allow you to go. Stretching or moving too far can cause an injury to occur. Tip: Use a slow and controlled motion.
    Remember to breathe out while twisting your body to the side and in when moving back to the starting position.
    Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

    Put your left hand under your left hipbone to pad your hip and pubic bone.
    Bend your right knee so you can hold the foot in your right hand.
    Lift the foot in the air and simultaneously lift your shoulders off the floor. This also stretches the right hip flexor and the chest and shoulders. Switch sides. If it doesn't bother your back, you can try it with both arms and legs at the same time.

    Latissimus dorsi SMR

Latissimus dorsi SMR

Latissimus dorsi self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment for the upper body, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other "trigger point" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the lat muscles of the mid back, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight area to relax or "release." Latissimus dorsi SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the pectorals or rhomboids, or by stretches that target the lats.
Benefits

    Can encourage blood flow to the latissimus dorsi muscles
    May be able to temporarily increase range of motion in the shoulder or elbow joints
    Effective as part of a warm-up or post-workout recovery
    May help contribute to temporary increases in range of motion in the thoracic spine

    While lying on the floor, place a foam roll under your back and to one side, just behind your arm pit. This will be your starting position.
    Keep the arm of the side being stretched behind and to the side of you as you shift your weight onto your lats, keeping your upper body off of the ground. Hold for 10-30 seconds, and switch sides.

    Lower back SMR

Lower back SMR

Lower back self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other "trigger point" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the quadratus lumborum or spinal erector (erector spinae) muscles of the lower back, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight area to relax or "release." Lower back SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the glutes or piriformis muscles, or by stretches that target the piriformis or hips. However, some people find that SMR on the lower back can aggravate existing pain or injury, so be cautious when performing it.
Benefits

    Some people find it can provide temporary relief from exercise-induced lower back soreness
    Can be done as part of a warm-up or post-workout recovery

Now shift your weight slightly to one side, keeping your weight off of the spine and on the muscles to the side of it. Roll over your lower back, holding points of tension for 10-30 seconds. Repeat on the other side.

    World's greatest stretch

World's greatest stretch

The world's greatest stretch is a popular movement that earned its name because it targets multiple parts of the body, including the hips, shoulders, and thoracic spine, in a single sequence. This makes it a great dynamic warm-up, post-workout stretch, or mobility work you can do anytime.
Benefits

    Stretches and mobilizes the hips, shoulders, and upper back
    Hits areas, like thoracic mobility, that most stretches don't
    Improves coordination and body control
    Great carryover for lifting or sports

    This is a three-part stretch. Begin by lunging forward, with your front foot flat on the ground and on the toes of your back foot. With your knees bent, squat down until your knee is almost touching the ground. Keep your torso erect, and hold this position for 10-20 seconds.
    Now, place the arm on the same side as your front leg on the ground, with the elbow next to the foot. Your other hand should be placed on the ground, parallel to your lead leg, to help support you during this portion of the stretch.
    After 10-20 seconds, place your hands on either side of your front foot. Raise the toes of the front foot off of the ground, and straighten your leg. You may need to reposition your rear leg to do so. Hold for 10-20 seconds, and then repeat the entire sequence for the other side.

    Stand up straight with the spine vertical, the left foot slightly in front of the right.
    Bend both knees and lift the back heel off the floor as you press the right hip forward. You can't get a thorough, deep stretch in this position, however, because it's hard to relax the hip flexor and stand on it at the same time. Switch sides.

    This drill helps increase arm efficiency during the run. Begin kneeling, left foot in front, right knee down. Apply pressure through the front heel to keep your glutes and hamstrings activated.
    Begin by blocking the arms in long, pendulum like swings. Close the arm angle, blocking with the arms as you would when jogging, progressing to a run and finally a sprint.
    As soon as your hands pass the hip, accelerate them forward during the sprinting motion to move them as quickly as possible.
    Switch knees and repeat.

    Adductors
    Adductor SMR

Adductor SMR

Adductor self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment for the lower body, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other "trigger point" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the adductor muscles in the inner thigh region, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight muscle to relax or "release." Adductor SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the iliotibial (IT) band or glutes (TFL muscles), or by stretches that target the adductors.
Benefits

    Can encourage blood flow to the adductor muscles
    May be able to temporarily increase range of motion in the hip joints
    Effective as part of a warm-up or post-workout recovery

    Type: Stretching
    Main Muscle Worked: Adductors
    Equipment: Foam Roll

    Lie face down with one leg on a foam roll.
    Rotate the leg so that the foam roll contacts against your inner thigh. Shift as much weight onto the foam roll as can be tolerated.
    While trying to relax the muscles if the inner thigh, roll over the foam between your hip and knee, holding points of tension for 10-30 seconds. Repeat with the other leg.

    One Handed Hang

One Handed Hang

The single-arm hang is a static exercise that involves hanging from a bar by one hand. It is an advanced hanging exercise that demands above-average shoulder stability and grip strength, and may not be appropriate for some people. However, if someone is strong and stable enough to perform it, the movement can help build those same qualities.
Benefits

    Easily regressed by doing single-hand switches on a bar
    Great stretch for the lats, shoulders, and pecs, and shoulder stabilization training for working arm
    Essential training for the one-arm chin-up and other advanced single-arm feats of strength

    Lie on your back with your feet raised towards the ceiling.
    Have your partner hold your feet or ankles. Abduct your legs as far as you can. This will be your starting position.
    Attempt to squeeze your legs together for 10 or more seconds, while your partner prevents you from doing so.
    Now, relax the muscles in your legs as your partner pushes your feet apart, stretching as far as is comfortable for you. Be sure to let your partner know when the stretch is adequate to prevent overstretching or injury.

    Brachialis SMR

Brachialis SMR

Brachialis self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment for the upper body, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other "trigger point" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the biceps or brachialis muscles of the upper arm, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight muscle to relax or "release." Brachialis SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the triceps muscles or pectorals, or by stretches that target the biceps or pecs.
Benefits

    Can encourage blood flow to the brachialis and biceps muscles
    May be able to temporarily increase range of motion in the shoulder or elbow joints
    Effective as part of a warm-up or post-workout recovery
    Along with SMR targeting the pecs, some people find it can provide temporary relief from certain types of exercise-derived shoulder pain

    Double-kettlebell windmill

Double-kettlebell windmill

The double-kettlebell windmill is an advanced kettlebell exercise emphasizing core strength and shoulder and hip mobility and stability. Because it involves holding one weight overhead while holding another under the torso, it builds strength across the core and stability in the shoulders. It doesn't work well in a metcon or conditioning setting, and shouldn't be performed under intense fatigue.
Benefits

    Builds strength throughout the abdomen, particularly the deep core (transversus abdominus) and obliques
    Gives intense strength stimulus even with relatively light weights
    Builds shoulder stability, hip mobility, and thoracic spine mobility
    Can use two different weights to change stimulus

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Shoulders
    Equipment: Kettlebells
    Level: Intermediate

Double-kettlebell windmill muscle diagram

    Place a kettlebell in front of your front foot and clean and press a kettlebell overhead with your opposite arm. Clean the kettlebell to your shoulder by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the kettlebell towards your shoulders. Rotate your wrist as you do so, so that the palm faces forward.
    Keeping the kettlebell locked out at all times, push your butt out in the direction of the locked out kettlebell. Turn your feet out at a forty-five degree angle from the arm with the locked out kettlebell.
    Bending at the hip to one side, sticking your butt out, slowly lean until you can retrieve the kettlebell from the floor. Keep your eyes on the kettlebell that you hold over your head at all times.
    Pause for a second after retrieving the kettlebell from the ground and reverse the motion back to the starting position.

    Lie on your back with your partner kneeling beside you.
    Flex the hip of one leg, raising it off of the floor. Rotate the leg so the foot is over the opposite hip, the lower leg perpendicular to your body. Your partner should hold the knee and ankle in place. This will be your starting position.
    Attempt to push your leg towards your partner, who should be preventing any actual movement of the leg.
    After 10-20 seconds, completely relax as your partner gently pushes the ankle and knee towards your chest. Be sure to inform your helper when the stretch is adequate to prevent injury or overstretching.

    Pass-through stretch with band

Pass-through stretch with band

The pass-through stretch with band is a popular move to build and maintain mobility in the shoulder joint and to strengthen the muscles of the upper back and rotator cuff. It is common in CrossFit and Olympic lifting training and is usually performed as part of a warm-up or paired with movements in a workout. It can also be performed with a PVC pipe or dowel if a band isn't available.
Benefits

    Mobilizes shoulder and boosts blood flow in shoulder stabilizer muscles
    Pulling outward against the band increases shoulder stability
    Gripping a band may be more comfortable for some people's shoulders than gripping a fixed object like a PVC pipe

    Type: Stretching
    Main Muscle Worked: Chest

    Start off by standing with your legs together, holding a bodybar or a broomstick.
    Take a slightly wider than shoulder width grip on the pole and hold it in front of you with your palms facing down.
    Carefully lift the pole up and behind your head.

Remain aware of your lower body alignment. Keep your stomach muscles tucked in and your lower back muscles contracted to avoid arching your lower back.

    Sit upright on the floor with your partner behind you. Raise one arm straight up, and flex the elbow, attempting to touch your hand to your back. Your parner should hold your tricep and wrist. This will be your starting position.
    Attempt to pull your upper arm to your side as your partner prevents you from doing actually doing so.
    After 10-20 seconds, relax the arm and allow your partner to further stretch the lat by applying gentle pressure to the tricep. Hold for 10-20 seconds, and then switch sides.

    Start off by rolling your torso forward onto the ball so your hips rest on top of the ball and become the highest point of your body.
    Rest your hands and feet on the floor. Your arms and legs can be slightly bent or straight, depending on the size of the ball, your flexibility, and the length of your limbs. This also helps develop stabilizing strength in your torso and shoulders.

    Medicine ball sprawl to chest press

Medicine ball sprawl to chest press

    From a standing position, press a pair of dumbbells overhead by extending the elbows and flexing the shoulders. You should be looking directly forward, with your chest up, knees and hips slightly bent, and your back straight. This will be your starting position.
    Descend into a squat by flexing your hips and knees. As you squat, keep your weight on your heels and push your knees out. Maintain proper curvature of your entire spine, from the lower back all the way up through your cervical spine.
    Descend as far as your flexibility allows or until you have reached a full squat position. Avoid excessive forward lean, rounding your lumbar or thoracic spine, and keep the dumbbell in place throughout the exercise.
    After a brief pause, return to the starting position by extending through the hips and knees. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions

    Set the bar in a rack slightly below shoulder level so that when under it, your knees are slightly bent. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids, pushing into the clavicles, and lightly touching the throat. Your hands should be in a clean grip, touching the bar only with your fingers to help keep it in position.
    Push upward into the bar and push your hips forward to unrack. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head and elbows up at all times. Your triceps should remain parallel with the ground. Keep a neutral neck and flat back. This will be your starting position.
    Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt back. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    As you prepare to ascend, push through your heels and begin to wrap your fingers tightly around the bar for a firm grip.
    Begin pressing the bar up towards the ceiling as you begin squatting upwards, allowing your neck to hyperextend so that the bar has room to move. A final position will be one in which your arms are fully extended overhead and knees slightly bent, maintaining tight ness from head to toe.
    Lower the bar slowly to the starting position, allowing your knees to bend slightly to lessen the blow. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.

    Single-arm half-kneeling shoulder press

Single-arm half-kneeling shoulder press

The single-arm half-kneeling shoulder press is a popular exercise to target the deltoid muscles while also developing strength and stability in the core and hips. Balance can be a challenge, which is one reason why this movement is generally trained lighter than standing single-arm shoulder presses. The half-kneeling press can be used as an accessory lift for the shoulder press or bench press, or simply as a technique to make shoulder presses stricter and more athletic.
Benefits

    Builds size and strength in the deltoids and triceps
    Forces the core to stabilize an uneven load
    Hips, back, and trunk all work to stabilize in a half-kneeling position

    Type: Strength

    Select an appropriate load and adopt a half-kneeling position on the floor. Your right knee should be down, and your left knee up; take the weight with your right hand. Clean the dumbbell to your shoulder, using both hands if necessary. You should start with a neutral grip, with the palm in. Keep your head up, shoulders back, and your spine neutral. This will be your starting position.
    Initiate the movement by extending the arm, flexing and abducting the shoulder to rotate the arm as you press above your head. Pause at the top of the motion before reversing the movement to return to the starting position.
    Complete the desired number of repetitions before switching to the opposite side.

Hand Stand Push-Up

The handstand push-up is an exercise targeting the shoulders, although other muscles assist in the completion of the reps. It is common in both CrossFit workouts and advanced bodyweight or calisthenics training. Given the degree of difficulty, beginners will want to progress to this move.
Benefits

    Builds and strengthens the shoulders
    The core works hard to maintain stability during the up-and-down movement
    If full ROM is too difficult at first, can reduce it by placing a pad under head

Hand Stand Push-Up Instructions
Hand Stand Push-Up muscle diagram

    Begin by facing a wall, standing 3 to 4 feet away from it. Bending at the waist, lower your arms down to the ground and place them 4 to 6 inches from the wall, while simultaneously kicking your legs up towards the wall—this is to be done in a quick, continuous motion.
    Keep your glutes and abdominals tight, and your arms and legs fully extended. This will be your starting position. Begin to lower yourself to the ground, maintaining fully extended legs and feet together. Keep your elbows at roughly a 45 degree angle—not flared completely out nor in a straight line with your upper arms.
    Lower yourself until the top of your head grazes the ground. Once the bottom position is achieved, push through the hands, keeping your legs straight, and glutes and core tight, and return to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended number of repetitions.

The plate-weighted push-up is a simple way to make a classic bodyweight exercise more difficult. It targets all the same muscles as the push-up: chest, triceps, shoulders, upper back, and core. You can balance a plate on your upper back yourself, but it's easier and safer to have someone else put it there. If you stack a few plates up, be sure to have a spotter close at hand.
Benefits

    Great for building the chest and triceps
    The weight plates allow for progressive resistance on a bodyweight exercise
    Can be performed as a dropset with bodyweight push-ups

Weighted Push-Up Instructions
Weighted Push-Up muscle diagram

    Start by holding a plate with both hands at chest level. Lower yourself down into a kneeling position, and bring the plate behind your head. Take one hand off of the plate and bring it down to the floor to help support your body while you place the weight on your back. Extend your legs back so that you are in a full plank position. Once the plate feels secure on your back, bring your other arm down and place your hands about 36 inches apart. This part can be simplified by having a partner place the weight on your back. This will be your starting position.
    Lower yourself down until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. Next, breathe out and press your upper body back into the starting position.
    Repeat this pattern for the desired number of repetitions.

    Dumbbell walking lunge-

Dumbbell walking lunge-

The dumbbell walking lunge is a popular lower-body movement that targets the muscles of the quads, glutes, hamstrings, and hips. It also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. The dumbbell walking lunge is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per leg or more, as part of the lower-body portion of a workout. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing reverse lunges or split squats instead.
Benefits

    Simple way to overload lunge movement pattern
    Shorter steps will target the quads more, while larger steps will target the glutes more
    Helps improve hip flexibility and core stability

    Step forward with one leg, flexing the knees to drop your hips. Descend until your rear knee touches the ground. Your posture should remain upright, and your front knee should stay above the front foot.
    Drive through the heel of your lead foot and extend both knees to raise yourself back up. Step forward with your rear foot, repeating the lunge on the opposite leg.
    Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.

Sumo Deadlift with Bands muscle diagram

    To deadlift with short bands, simply loop them over the bar before you start, and step into them to set up. Ensure that they under the back half of your foot, directly where you are driving into the floor.
    Begin with a bar loaded on the ground. Approach the bar so that the bar intersects the middle of the feet. The feet should be set very wide, near the collars. Bend at the hips to grip the bar. The arms should be directly below the shoulders, inside the legs, and you can use a pronated grip, a mixed grip, or hook grip.
    Take a breath, and then lower your hips, looking forward with your head with your chest up. Drive through the floor, spreading your feet apart, with your weight on the back half of your feet. Extend through the hips and knees.
    As the bar passes through the knees, lean back and drive the hips into the bar, pulling your shoulder blades together.
    Return the weight to the ground by bending at the hips and controlling the weight on the way down.

    Barbell reverse lunge

Barbell reverse lunge

The barbell reverse lunge is a popular lower-body exercise targeting the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. Using a barbell allows you to overload the exercise beyond body weight and perform the movement in strength or muscle-focused rep ranges. The reverse lunge can be performed as part of a barbell complex, in a circuit, or on its own in the lower-body portion of any workout.
Benefits

    Serious challenge to all lower-body muscles
    Many lifters find it more knee-friendly than forward or walking lunges
    The stationary front leg helps maintain balance
    Great accessory movement for squats

    Type: Strength

Barbell reverse lunge Instructions
Barbell reverse lunge muscle diagram

    Position a weighted bar across your upper back holding the ends with your hands to keep it stable. Alternately, you can do this in a squat rack to more easily get into the starting position. Stand erect with your chest out and your shoulders back, maintaining the natural curve in your back and knees unlocked. Your feet should be about hip width apart. This is your starting position.
    Staying erect, initiate the movement by stepping back with one foot about 2 feet, keeping your hips facing forward as the toe of your back foot makes contact first. Then allow both knees to bend and descend just short of allowing your trailing knee to touch the floor.
    Your body should continue to be upright. Don't lean forward or allow you back to round. Press back up by pushing through your back foot maintaining balance as you return to the starting position.
    Repeat on the opposite side, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

Single-Leg Box Jump Instructions
Single-Leg Box Jump muscle diagram

    Select a box or step of a height appropriate to your abilities. Single-leg jumps will require lower boxes than double-legged versions, and caution should be used due to a higher risk associated with the exercise. To begin, stand 6-12 inches in front of the box. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, your knees and hips slightly bent, with good posture throughout your spine. This will be your starting position.
    To initiate the movement, lift one foot slightly off the floor to transfer the load to the working leg. Begin flexing the hips and knees into a quarter squat, generating an elastic force that will be used to power your jump. Swing your arms behind you in preparation for the movement.
    Explode out of the hole, extending your hip, knee, and ankle of your working leg to propel you upward and slightly forward, striving for maximum height. Swing your arms forward as you jump for added momentum.
    As you land on the platform, absorb the impact by allowing the hips and knees to flex into a partial squat. Use both legs to step down and return to the starting position. It is not advised to jump down from the box during this exercise.

    Load the bar to an appropriate weight for your training. Attach short bands to the bar, anchoring them to heavy dumbbells that cannot move.
    Lay on the bench with your feet flat on the ground, driving through with your hips. Your back should be arched and your shoulder blades retracted.
    Take a medium pronated grip, covering the rings on the bar. Remove the bar from the rack, holding the weight above your clavicle with your arms extended. This will be your starting position.
    Lower the bar by displacing your elbows forward. The bar should only move vertically, making the exercise resemble a hybrid bench press and skull-crusher.
    Lower the weight but stop short of allowing it to touch your chest, then return the bar to the starting position.

    Begin standing under a bar with your legs shoulder-width apart. This will be your starting position.
    Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Place your hands on the floor and kick your legs back so you end up with your stomach and thighs on the floor. Your elbows should be bent. This should be done quickly.
    From this position, press up like you're doing a push-up and push your hips up. Jump your feet under your hips and begin to stand as you prepare to jump up.
    Finish the movement by jumping in the air and bringing your hands over your head to grab a strong hold on the bar. Immediately pull yourself up until your chin is just above the bar. This is one repetition.
    Descend from the pull-up by allowing your arms to extend and then let go of the bar to return to the ground. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.

    Barbell pull-over to press

Barbell pull-over to press

The barbell pull-over to press is a complex that combines two popular exercises into one sequence that works much of the upper body, particularly the chest, triceps, and serratus anterior muscles. It is commonly performed with an EZ-bar, but can also be performed with a straight bar or neutral-grip bar. Because the pull-over will determine the amount of weight you can use, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body portion of a workout.
Benefits

    Hits numerous upper-body muscles at once
    Stretches and strengthens the front and back sides of the upper body
    Great pump to finish an upper-body workout

    Type: Strength
    Main Muscle Worked: Lats

    Lay on a flat bench with your feet flat on the floor. Hold a barbell on your chest with a shoulder-width, pronated grip. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping the elbows bent to about 90 degrees, rotate the barbell over and behind your head.
    Return the barbell to your chest, again keeping the elbows again fixed at the same angle.
    Press the barbell straight up by extending the elbows, and then return the weight to the starting position.

Typewriter push-up

The typewriter push-up is an advanced push-up variation where the hands are extra wide and you lower toward each hand in alternating reps. It is more challenging to each working arm than traditional push-ups and also stretches and challenges the chest.
Benefits

    Far more challenging than normal push-ups
    Excellent build-up to single-arm push-ups
    Increased challenge to triceps and chest

    Type: Strength

    Begin in the "up" position of a push-up: arms extended, back and neck in a straight line, and core tight. This will be your starting position.
    Descend into the bottom position of the push-up by flexing at the elbows into a 90-degree position.
    Lean (and shift your body weight) to one side by attempting to place your front deltoid on your palm. Simultaneously, extend your opposite arm into a straight line. Your bent arm may move slightly to accommodate your other arm fully extending. This is okay.
    Next, transition your weight to your opposite arm, repeating the same motions. Once completed, this is one repetition.
    Rock back and forth, and repeat for recommended number of repetitions.

Rack Delivery Instructions
Rack Delivery muscle diagram

    This drill teaches the delivery of the barbell to the rack position on the shoulders. Begin holding a bar in the scarecrow position, with the upper arms parallel to the floor, and the forearms hanging down. Use a hook grip, with your fingers wrapped over your thumbs.
    Begin by rotating the elbows around the bar, delivering the bar to the shoulders. As your elbows come forward, relax your grip. The shoulders should be protracted, providing a shelf for the bar, which should lightly contact the throat.
    It is important that the bar stay close to the body at all times, as with a heavier load any distance will result in an unwanted collision. As the movement becomes smoother, speed and load can be increased before progressing further.

    Dumbbell suitcase carry

Dumbbell suitcase carry

The dumbbell suitcase carry is similar to a dumbbell farmer's carry, but only uses one dumbbell rather than two. This simple change provides a significant challenge to the abdominal muscles. It can be a challenging finisher to any workout, or work well in fat-loss circuit training or as an accessory movement to heavy lifts like the deadlift.
Benefits

    Strengthens and challenges the grip, core, traps, upper back, shoulders, and legs
    Serious cardiovascular challenge and calorie burn
    Significant core and oblique challenge due to the single-sided loading
    Builds muscular coordination and mental toughness in addition to strength and muscle

Dumbbell suitcase carry Instructions
Dumbbell suitcase carry muscle diagram

    Place a dumbbell on the floor in front of you, making sure you have enough open space to walk. If you can’t reach the floor safely without rounding and twisting your back, elevate the weight off the floor. (When doing this as a competition, start side by side with your partner and make sure there’s enough room for both of you.)
    Squat down keeping your back flat—don’t bend over—and grasp the weight with a neutral grip. Keep your body square as much as possible. Stand back up by extending at the hips and knees; this will be your starting position.
    Keeping the weight at your side and maintaining a body position that doesn’t favor one side, walk forward as far as you can; if necessary turn around and return the other way. Try to beat your partner for both distance and time.
    Descend into a squat to lower the weight back to the floor.

    Quadriceps
    Dumbbell front squat

Dumbbell front squat

The dumbbell front squat is a popular exercise for targeting the muscles of the lower body, including the quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings. Holding dumbbells in the racked position also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Because the amount of weight you can use will be limited by what you can clean to the rack position, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set or more. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing it with a wider stance.
Benefits

    Serious work for the legs, glutes, and hamstrings
    Can work in strength or muscle-focused rep ranges
    Adds a challenge to the upper back, shoulders, and core to maintain proper posture

    Type: Strength

Dumbbell front squat Instructions
Dumbbell front squat muscle diagram

    Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, holding a pair of light dumbbells down by your sides. Clean the dumbbells up to your shoulders so that one end of each dumbbell rests on top of each shoulder. Balance the dumbbells on your shoulder by holding on to dumbbells with elbows facing forward. This will be your starting position.
    Keeping your head facing forward, your back straight, and your chest high, squat down by bending your hips back while allowing knees to come forward slightly, keeping your back straight and knees pointed in the same direction as your feet. Descend until your thighs are at parallel, or just past parallel to floor.
    To return to the starting position, extend your knees and hips until your legs are straight. Repeat for the recommended number of reps.

Split Clean Instructions
Split Clean muscle diagram

    With a barbell on the floor close to the shins, take an overhand grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.
    Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.
    Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.
    As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so.
    Receive the bar with the feet split, aggressively moving one foot forward and one foot back. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom position, which will help in the recovery.
    Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Bring the feet together as you stand up.

    Dumbbell lateral hop to sprint

Dumbbell lateral hop to sprint

The dumbbell lateral hop to sprint is a multi-part explosive exercise combining weighted hops with weighted sprinting. Adding dumbbells adds a challenge to the core and shoulders. Because balance can be a challenge, it is usually performed with relatively light weights, often as a component of fat-loss or athletic training.
Benefits

    Strengthens the legs, hips, and core in the lateral plane
    Serious cardiovascular challenge and calorie burn
    Helps improve vertical jump and acceleration

    Type: Plyometrics

    Complete for recommended number of reps or time.

Plate shoulder circle big to small

The plate shoulder circle big to small is an exercise targeting the shoulder complex. Typically, this is considered a warm-up move rather than a working exercise. It warms up the shoulder joint and works small and hard-to-attack muscles such as the rotator cuff group.
Benefits

    Great for warming up the shoulder muscles and lubricating the shoulder joint
    Hits smaller muscles in the shoulder complex that tend to get overlooked when pressing
    Promotes balanced shoulder development

    Stand erect holding two 5-lb. plates directly out to your sides, arms fully extended. Position your thumbs on the outer edge of the plates and several fingers through the inside hole for a more secure grip. The plates should be horizontal to the floor. This will be your starting position.
    Using a circular but deliberate motion do multiple arm circles, first starting with a small rotation and progressing to larger ones. Reverse course so you're again doing progressively smaller circles, then switch so you’re doing it in the opposite direction. Again repeat from a smaller to larger circular motion.

    Quadriceps
    Close-stance dumbbell front squat

Close-stance dumbbell front squat

The close-stance dumbbell front squat is a popular exercise for targeting the muscles of the lower body, the quadriceps in particular. Holding dumbbells in the racked position also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Because the amount of weight you can use will be limited by what you can clean to the rack position, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set or more. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing it with a wider stance.
Benefits

    Serious work for the legs, glutes, and hamstrings
    Encourages good hip mobility to reach full depth
    Adds a challenge to the upper back, shoulders, and core to maintain proper posture

    Type: Strength

    Position your legs using a very narrow stance (feet a few inches apart) with the toes slightly pointed out and knees slightly bent. Hold a dumbbell (hand on each end) at chest level, with your elbows tucked inwards to your side. Keep your neck neutral and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.
    Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Once you reach your bottom position, begin to push through your heels to ascend upwards and return to the starting position.
    Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.

    Set the bar in a rack slightly below shoulder level so that when under it, your knees are slightly bent.

Keep your head and elbows up at all times. Your triceps should remain parallel with the ground. Keep a neutral neck and flat back. This will be your starting position.
    Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.

    Adjust the straps to put the handles around chest height. Facing the suspension system, grasp the handles with a supinated (underhand) grip. Keeping your body rigid, lean back allowing your elbows to straighten. This will be your starting position.
    Perform the movement by flexing the elbows, pulling yourself upward. Do not cheat or compensate, using only your biceps to execute the exercise. At the top of the motion, pause, and then lower yourself to the staring position.

    Set the bar up in a power rack. Attach bands to the top of the rack, using either bands pegs or the frame itself. Attach the other end of the bands to the bar.
    Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets.
    With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward.
    After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.
    Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.

    Start on the floor in a seated position with your hands placed behind you slightly wider than shoulder-distance apart. Extend your legs out in front of you, and lean back slightly. This will be your starting position.
    Start by swinging your legs out to the side, then up towards your chest, and back down to the starting position. Essentially making a large circle. As you bring your legs towards you, lift your chest up, bringing it closer to your legs.
    Alternate directions, moving clockwise to counterclockwise with each repetition. Try to keep your back straight and your abs engaged the entire time.
    Complete for the recommended number of repetitions.
    Tip: To make it easier, have a slight bend at the knees.

    Begin with a bar on a rack at about the same height as your stomach. Bend over underneath the bar and rack the bar across the rear of your shoulders as you would a power squat, not on top of your shoulders. At the proper height, you should be near parallel to the floor when bent over. Keep your back tight, shoulder blades pinched together, and your knees slightly bent. Keep your back arched and your cervical spine in proper alignment.
    Begin the motion by extending through the hips with your glutes and hamstrings, and you are standing with the weight. Slowly lower the weight back to the pins returning to the starting position.

    Barbell front squat to back squat

Barbell front squat to back squat

The barbell front squat to back squat is a complex that combines two fundamental barbell squat movements with a press in between to build overall strength, coordination, and endurance. This combo hits every muscle in the lower body, but also seriously challenges the upper-body musculature to control and transition the weight.
Benefits

    Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings
    Builds shoulders, core, and upper back
    Great for conditioning and cardiovascular work
    Challenging even with light weight

    Type: Strength

    This variation is a 1:1 ratio of a front squat right to into a back squat using a belt.
    To step up for the front squat, place your pinkies on the ring of the barbell with your thumbs off of the smooth part. Bring your arms up under the bar while keeping your elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.
    This variation is a 1:1 ratio of a front squat right to into a back squat using a belt.
    Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Perform the front squat for the recommended number of repetitions, rack the bar, and immediately set up for the back squat.
    Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.

    Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel or middle of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

It can be done as a full-body warm-up, or as part of a bodyweight circuit or flow.
Benefits

    Cardiovascular and muscular challenge even with no added weight
    Demands greater coordination and shoulder, arm, and core strength than traditional bear crawls

    Bend down so that your hands are on the ground and your feet hip-distance a part. Your shoulders should be stacked over your wrists, your knees bent to 90 degrees, your back flat, and abs engaged. This will be your starting position.
    Quickly bring one hand up to tap the opposite-side shoulder, placing that hand back on the floor before repeating to the opposite side. Concurrently your body will slightly shift from one side to the other to better maintain balance. Try to avoid your hips rocking from side to side.
    Continue for the recommended number of repetitions.

    Begin in an athletic position with your knees bent, your feet shoulder-width apart, and your arms bent and at your sides.
    Lift your right knee high and step laterally to the right. As soon as your right foot hits the ground, lift your left knee high and step it toward your right foot.
    When your left foot touches the ground. Lift your right knee again and take another lateral step.
    Repeat this motion by taking three steps in one direction and three steps in the other.
    From there, jump forward 2-3 feet. You should be in the same position you started.
    Move quickly and stay on your toes.
